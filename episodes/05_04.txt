At Burns' mansion. The shots pans down past several signs on the gate: Keep Out, Danger Electrified Fence, Trespassers Will Be Shot, and Free Kittens - Inquire Within. Outside the front door, several guards march up and down, chanting.

GUARDS
All we own, we o-own, all we own, we o-own.

SMITHERS
 Shh!

GUARDS
 All we own, we o-own, all we own, we o-own...

Inside the mansion, Burns is in bed. We see his dream - a young Burns, playing with a stuffed bear.

BURNS
Tra-la-la-la-la-la! Tra-la-la-la-la! I'm the happiest boy there is, aren't I, Bobo?

A limousine pulls up, and the passenger talks to Burns' parents.

MOTHER
Happy! Come here, Happy!

BURNS
Yes, Mumsy?

FATHER
Happy, would you like to continue living with us, your loving natural parents, or would you rather live with this twisted, loveless billionaire?

Burns drops the bear, jumps into the limo, and puts sunglasses on.

BURNS
Let's roll!

FATHER
 Wait! You forgot your bear, a symbol of your lost youth and innocence! Ah, oh well, at least we still have his little brother George.

GEORGE
 Bwa bwa bwa bwa, Oh the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky Home, Bwa bwa bwa bwa...  Trust me, it'll be funny when I'm an old man.

The dream fades back to the present. Burns tosses and turns in his bed, holding a Nev-R-Break snow globe.

BURNS
I want my... teddy...

Smithers walks in as he drops the snow globe.

BURNS
Bobo... Bobo...  Huh? Oh, it's you. The bedpan's under my pillow.

SMITHERS
Who's Bobo, sir?

BURNS
Bobo? Uh, I... I... I meant Lobo! Uh, Sheriff Lobo, they never should have cancelled that show.

SMITHERS
I see. On another topic the preparations for your birthday have begun.

BURNS
I won't get what I really want.

SMITHERS
No one does...

Smithers imagines a naked Mr. Burns popping out of a birthday cake, singing.

BURNS
Happy Birthday, Mr. Smithers!

Smithers groans with pleasure. At the Simpsons home, Homer tosses in bed.

HOMER
Lobo... Lobo... Bring back Sheriff Lobo... Lobo... Lobo!  Aaah!

MARGE
What is it?

Homer points to the calendar by the bed.

HOMER
Oh no! Burns' birthday!

MARGE
What's wrong?

HOMER
Every time Mr. Burns has a birthday, all the employees have to help out at the party. And I always get some terrible job.

He recalls holding a piñata while a blindfolded Burns swings at it.

BURNS
Where is that dreaded piñata?

HOMER
 Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Missed me, heh heh!  Ow.

Back to reality, and Marge has fallen back asleep.

Later that day at work, Homer is being played a prank on by his co-workers. They look on and laugh as Homer struggles to remove a coat hanger stuck in his shirt.

HOMER
Not funny! And the one in my pant really hurts!

Everyone laughs harder. Meanwhile, Burns watches him on the security monitors.

BURNS
That man who's getting all those laughs, Smithers - who is he?

SMITHERS
Homer Simpson, sir, one of the carbon blobs from sector 7-G, but I don't think--

BURNS
I want this Simpson fellow to perform comedy at my party. I must harness his fractured take on modern life.

SMITHERS
Fine, sir. I'll get him started on some snappy Sinbad-esque material.

Back at home, Homer writes his comedy act.

HOMER
 Hee hee hee, I'm so funny. This is gonna be great!

MARGE
What are you doing?

HOMER
I'm writing a delicious send-up of Mr. Burns for his birthday party. Is poopoo one word or two?

Homer & Bart laugh.

MARGE
I don't think it's a good idea to humiliate your boss on his birthday.

LISA
Actually, Mom, a tweaking of Mr. Burns' foibles if done with the greatest of care could earn Dad a special place in the old man's heart.

HOMER
Well, I also do a delightful impression of him.  I paint a frowny face on my butt and pull down my pants!

Bart laughs and gives Homer a high-five. Marge and Lisa groan.

It's Burns' birthday. Homer practices his comedy act in front of the mirror.

HOMER
Now, I'm not saying Mr. Burns is incontinent...

BART
Incontinent!  Too rich!

LISA
Does either of you know what incontinent means?

HOMER
Lisa, don't spoil our fun.

MARGE
Come on, everybody, it's time to go.

HOMER
Okay, stupid!

MARGE
Homer, you've got to stop insulting everyone, especially your boss!

HOMER
Marge, the comedy roast is an American tradition. It's what gives us the freedom to criticize our social betters.  Hey Flanders! You smell like manure!

FLANDERS
Uh oh. Better cancel that dinner party tonight. Thanks for the nose news, neighbor!

At the party, the guests enter. Former President George Bush is pulled aside by one of the guards.

GUARD
Hey! No one-termers.

Bush is pushed aside. Jimmy Carter has also been refused entry.

CARTER
You too, huh? Hey, I know a good yogurt place.

BUSH
Get away from me, loser.

Inside Burns' mansion. Smithers introduces the party.

SMITHERS
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Montgomery Burns: the life.

He shows some slides from Mr. Burns' life. A slide showing Burns with Bobo comes up.

BURNS
Oh, Bobo...

SMITHERS
Here are several fine young men who I'm sure are gonna go far. Ladies and gentlemen, the Ramones!

BURNS
Ah, these minstrels will soothe my jangled nerves.

RAMONE #1
I'd just like to say this gig sucks!

RAMONE #2
Hey, up yours, Springfield.

RAMONE #1
One, two, three, four!  Happy birthday to you!

RAMONE #2
 Happy birthday!

RAMONE #1
Happy birthday to you!

RAMONE #2
 Happy birthday!

RAMONE #1
Happy birthday, Burnsie, happy birthday to you!

RAMONE #3
Go to hell, you old bastard!

The song finishes and the curtain closes.

RAMONE #4
Hey, I think they liked us.

BURNS
Have the Rolling Stones killed.

SMITHERS
But sir, those aren't the--

BURNS
Do as I say!

Burns opens his presents.

BURNS
Uh, stink, piffle... Dust Buster? Ugh...

Marge groans. Smithers brings a TV screen into view.

SMITHERS
Sir, I've arranged for the people of Australia to join hands tonight and spell out your name with candles. There's a satellite hookup on that monitor if you'll just turn your head slightly.

BURNS
Bah! No time! Next!

SMITHERS
I have some sad news to report. A small puppy, not unlike Lassie, was just run over in the parking lot.  And now it's time for the comedy stylings of Homer Simpson!

Homer comes on stage.

HOMER
 Are you ready to laugh?

MAN
Poor dog.

HOMER
 I said, are you ready to laugh?

WOMAN
Quiet, you awful man!

HOMER
You know, Mr. Burns is so cheap!

BURNS
What?

HOMER
I mean, y'know, Mr. Burns is so old!

BURNS
How dare you!

HOMER
 Whoo, tough crowd. Better bring out the big guns.  Here's an impression of Mr. Burns that you might find a little... cheeky!

He turns round, bends over and drops his pants to reveal a face painted on his butt. He wiggles his butt to the crowd.

HOMER
 I'm Mr. Burns! Blah blah blah! I think I'm so big, blah blah blah! Do this, do that, blah blah blah!

BURNS
Destroy him.

Several guards approach him, wielding clubs.

HOMER
Bla bla bla--  Ow!

BURNS
This party is over!

A riot squad enters the room and causes chaos.

Back at the Simpsons' home. Homer has a lump on his head.

HOMER
Oh, where did I lose 'em? I'll never wiggle my bare butt in public again.

LISA
I'd like to believe that this time, I really would.

MARGE
Bart, run down to the store and get a bag of ice for your father's head.

BART
Yes'm.  Dad, I know you're discouraged, but please don't deny the world your fat can.

HOMER
Don't worry boy, she'll be ready for your Aunt Selma's birthday.

LISA
I knew it...

At Burns' mansion, Smithers tries to comfort Burns.

SMITHERS
Look at all the wonderful things you have, sir: King Arthur's Excalibur; the only existing nude photo of Mark Twain; and that rare first draft of the constitution with the word "suckers" in it.

BURNS
Yes yes yes, so what?

SMITHERS
You want your Bobo, don't you?

BURNS
Liar! I'll give you the thrashing of a lifetime!  Resistance is futile!  Oh God, how I want my bear. But he's gone, gone forever. I'd give anything to know what happened to him.

The next few scenes follow Bobo's journey. The bear remains in the snow where it was dropped. When the snow melts, the bear is swept into the river. It is picked up in 1927 by a man who gives it to Charles Lindberg.

MAN
Why, put some grease in your garter, Lindy, you're late!

Lindberg flies off in a plane. He passes over Germany where a young Adolf Hitler catches Bobo as it falls. Later, in 1947, Hitler is in a bunker, while Germany is being bombed. He picks up the bear.

HITLER
This is all your fault!

He throws the bear outside. Next we see it in 1957, atop a submarine about to dive. Bobo becomes frozen in a block of ice, and is dug up in the Arctic in the present day. He is packed into a bag of ice, and put in a van. The van then arrives at the Kwik-E-Mart, and the men unload the bags of ice.

MAN
You've gotta start selling this for more than a dollar a bag. We lost four more men on this expedition.

APU
If you can think of a better way to get ice, I'd like to hear it.

The men chatter, unable to think of one.

MAN
Beats me.

 Bart picks up a bag.

BART
Hey Apu, this bag of ice has a head in it.

APU
Ooh, a head bag! Those are choc-full of... heady goodness!

Bart opens the bag back at home and pulls out Bobo.

BART
Hey, it's a teddy bear. Ugh, gross, it's probably diseased or something. Here Maggie.

He gives the bear to Maggie. A close up of the bear shows a "100% COTTON" label, and then a label marked "Bobo".

 

At Burns' mansion, Smithers enters wearing a bear costume.

SMITHERS
Here's something that should cheer you up, sir. It's me sir, Bobo!  Hug me, squeeze me, tug at my fur!

BURNS
 Ugh, enough! Stop this grotesque charade. Now find my teddy!  Oh and, er, leave the costume.

Kent Brockman delivers the news. Homer watches, while Maggie plays with Bobo in front of him.

KENT BROCKMAN
The Burns bear, perhaps the most valuable widdle bear in the world, could be anywhere. It could be in your house... You could be looking at it right now.  It could be right in front of your face as I'm saying this, waggling back and forth, perhaps being held up by a loved one.

HOMER
Maggie, I'm trying to watch TV. Put that moldy old bear down.  Moldy? Old? I'm gonna get something to eat!

Professor Frink has invented a robot bear for Mr. Burns.

FRINK
Well, it's not your original bear, of course, ng-hee, but it is programmed to be just as cuddly.

He turns it on using a remote control, but the bear seems to be evil. It grabs Burns.

FRINK
 Doggone it. It's supposed to be doing a little dance...

SMITHERS
I got it!

He smashes a chair over the bear's head.

FRINK
I'll try to turn it off...

BEAR
No, bear want to live! Aah!

The bear breaks through the wall to Burns' mansion.

While Lisa meditates to sea music in the living room, Maggie places the bear behind the fish tank. Bart knocks over a lamp which shines eerily onto the tank. At the top of the stairs, Homer trips on Bart's skateboard and falls down the stairs, hitting his head several times on the way down.

HOMER
Ah! D'oh! Ow! Son of a... D'oh! Stupid... stair!

 Upon reaching the bottom, he notices the fish tank.

HOMER
 How long have we had these fish?  Wait, it's a bear... Burns' bear!

The family sit round the kitchen table with the bear. Lisa checks the label.

LISA
Bobo. It's Mr. Burns' bear all right.

HOMER
Well Burns isn't getting this back cheap. He's gonna have to give me... my own recording studio.

He imagines himself singing with a brass ensemble.

HOMER
Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame-seed bun...  oh...

TECHNICIAN
Homer, you're drooling on the mike again.

Back to reality, and Homer is still drooling.

LISA
I think we should just give him the bear he cherishes so much.

Homer and Bart burst out laughing. Marge inspects the bear.

MARGE
Hmm... better sew that eye back on.

BART
No, let's send Burns the eye in the mail. He'll pay more money if he thinks the bear's in danger.

HOMER
 Yes, we'll send the eye.

MARGE
I'm sure he'll offer us a fair reward.  And then we'll make him double it!

FAMILY
Huh?

MARGE
Well why can't I be greedy once in a while?

Homer takes the bear to Mr. Burns.

BURNS
Bobo, my beautiful Bobo. I promise I'll never leave you behind again.  Ah, yes. Er, naturally I can't pay you much of a reward because I'm strapped for cash.

The ceiling collapses, covering him in gold coins and jewels.

BURNS
As you can see, this old place is falling apart. But, I'm sure we can come to an understanding.

HOMER
Yes, sir.  Reject the first offer. Reject the first offer.

BURNS
May I offer you a drink?

HOMER
Sorry, Burns, no deal!

Homer takes the bear and leaves.

BURNS
Don't worry Smithers. He's playing hardball now, but it won't take him long to crack.

Homer is sat at home. A cracking noise is heard, and Homer lunges for the phone.

HOMER
I gotta call Burns, I gotta call Burns! Maybe I can still get that drink!

BART
 Dad, the longer he has to wait, the more he'll pay.

HOMER
Right, that makes sense.

He suddenly dives onto the phone and tries to dial, but the whole family, including the pets, pull him back. A knock is heard at the door. Homer answers with the family still holding onto him. It's Burns.

HOMER
I knew you'd come crawling back.

BURNS
 How much do you want?

HOMER
A million dollars and three Hawaiian islands. Good ones, not the leper one.

BURNS
Done! Now give me that bear!

HOMER
Woohoo! I'm rich! Rich I tells ya! Here you go!

Homer tries to pick up the bear, but Maggie is holding onto it.

HOMER
 It seems to be caught on something... Bad baby! Bad Maggie!

He finally wrestles it out of Maggie grasp, but she starts crying. Homer is unsure what to do.

BURNS
Give me the bear!

SMITHERS
The bear! The bear!

Homer gives the bear back to Maggie.

HOMER
Here you go, Maggie. The deal's off, Mr. Burns. The bear stays here.

BURNS
You've made a mistake, Simpson!

Smithers growls as they both leave.

HOMER
Big deal! Who needs his money? We're getting along fine.

Suddenly, Abe crashes a car through the wall of the Simpsons' home.

ABE
Son, you gotta help me! I hit three people on the way over here, and I don't have any insurance!  So, how's my Ute?

 

It is night-time. Burns and Smithers stand atop Flanders' roof, dressed in black. Smithers shoots an arrow attached to a wire onto the Simpsons' roof.

BURNS
Excellent shot, Smithers. I'll be squeezing my Bobo in no time.

Flanders pops his head out of the attic window.

FLANDERS
Howdy, gents, what can I diddily-do ya for?

Burns sprays something in his face, and he faints.

BURNS
Remember Smithers. In and out in eighteen seconds.

They slide down the wire, but get stuck in the middle. They stay there until morning when the firemen rescue them. Burns is sitting in an ambulance, wrapped in a blanket.

MARGE
More cocoa, Mr. Burns?

BURNS
Yes.

The next night. Burns and Smithers get into the house, and crawl along the ceiling using suction pads. They are halfway across the kitchen when Homer, half asleep and in his underwear, enters and takes some cheese out of the fridge. He sits down at the table.

HOMER
Mmm... sixty four slices of American cheese.  Sixty four... sixty three...

Fade to morning, and he is struggling to finish.

HOMER
Two... One...

MARGE
 Homer, have you been up all night eating cheese?

HOMER
I think I'm blind.

Burns and Smithers lose suction in their pads and fall to the floor. They get up quickly and brush themselves off.

HOMER
Wha?

BURNS
Good day to you. 

At work the next day, fellow workmates gather round him.

MAN 1
Excuse me, we wanted to see the geek who valued the happiness of his children more than money.

HOMER
 Right here.

MAN 2
Aw, you said his head was the size of a baseball.

HOMER
Oh, my life can't get any worse.

SMITHERS
 Homer Simpson, report for much worse duties.

HOMER
D'oh!

Homer's "much worse" duty consists of him walking in a circle in the basement, turning a large gear, while being whipped by an executioner.

HOMER
 Ow!  D'oh! After lunch, can I whip you?

EXECUTIONER
No.

HOMER
Oh, no fair.  Ow!

The view pans up a long way to the cafeteria, where Homer's efforts simply rotate a display of cakes. Lenny and Carl pass by.

LENNY
Mmm, I wonder what makes it turn.

CARL
Who cares?

Back at home again. Homer tries to coax the bear away from Maggie.

HOMER
Maggie, I know you like the bear, but wouldn't you be just as happy playing with...  this box!  See Maggie? See the fun box? Do-do-do-do-do-do!

Maggie reaches for the box.

HOMER
No! My box! My box!

He runs to the other side of the room and plays by himself. Later in the bedroom, Marge enters from the en suite, her hair in a mess.

MARGE
Mmm, I think we need a new hairdryer.

HOMER
Marge, you must hate me for not taking Mr. Burns' money.

MARGE
I don't hate you, I'm proud of you! You came through for your daughter when she needed you the most.

HOMER
Aw, thanks Marge. But it'll take a lot more than that to comfort this tortured sole.  Hee boxy!

MARGE
 Gimme that!

HOMER
Aw...

Homer watches Barney the Dinosaur on TV.

BARNEY
Two plus two is four, two plus two is four, two plus two is four...

HOMER
 I can see why this show is so popular. Look at him. Heh.

Suddenly, the program is cut off and Mr. Burns appears on screen.

BURNS
Give me my bear, Simpson!

HOMER
Aah!

He changes channels.

TV PRESENTER
It's the sooooouuuul mass transit system!

Burns rushes on screen, panting.

BURNS
 Give it to me!

Homer changes channel again. This time the Spanish Bee is playing with an oversized yoyo.

SPANISH BEE
Ay, el yoyo is grande!

Burns runs on screen and pushes the bee out of the way.

SPANISH BEE
Ay, chihuahua!

BURNS
As you can see, Simpson, I have taken over all 78 channels. And you won't see any of your favorite shows again until you give in.

OTTO
 Whoa, that bites.

PATTY
 Holy crap!

BURNS
What's that you say? You can live without television so long as you have beer?

HOMER
That's right.

BURNS
Wrong. All beer trucks heading towards Springfield have been diverted. This town will be as dry as a bone. And if the rest of you beer-swilling tube-jockeys out there have a problem with this, talk to Homer Simpson. 

The doorbell then rings. It is Barney. He points a gun at Homer.

BARNEY
Homer, give him what he wants!

HOMER
Oh Barney, leave me alone!

He slams the door in Barney's face.

BARNEY
Whoops!

He is heard falling backwards. A shot is fired, smashing glass is heard, then a woman screaming, then a police siren.

BARNEY
Uh-oh.

Bart is at school, surrounded by bullies.

NELSON
My old man can't get a beer because his old man won't give a bear to another old man. Let's get him!

JIMBO
Wait! Why are we gettin' him?

MARTIN
 Look, fellas. The first snapdragon of the season!

NELSON
Never mind. Let's just get him!

JIMBO
Yeah!

They chase after Martin, knocking Bart over as they run.

A sitcom starring Burns and Smithers is on TV. Burns enters a house

BURNS
Smithers, I'm home! 

SMITHERS
What, already? 

BURNS
Yes! 

LISA
Is it my imagination, or is TV getting worse.

HOMER
Eh, it's about the same. Uh-oh! Look out Smithers!

The sound of smashing glass can be heard, along with more canned laughter. Homer laughs.

HOMER
Heh heh. I love this show.

An angry mob appear outside the Simpsons' front window.

HOMER
Well, well, look who's come to apologize.

MOE
 Come on, let's go in there and get the bear!

The crowd cheers and storms the house.

MOE
Ha! Got it!

 Moe takes Bobo from Maggie and it is passed towards the door. The mob starts to leave, but see Maggie crying.

MOE
Aw jeez, would you look at that.

JASPER
What have we become?

DR. HIBBERT
We've given the word "mob" a bad name.

They pass the bear back, and go outside.

MOE
Well, what should we do now?

SKINNER
Hey everyone! Let's go sing at the hospital!

The crowd cheers and walks off, singing.

CROWD
For we've got high hopes,
We've got high hopes...

Later. The doorbell rings. It is Mr. Burns.

BURNS
Simpson, look what you've reduced me to.

He clicks his fingers, and Smithers enters on his knees, begging.

SMITHERS
Please! Please!

HOMER
But Mr. Burns, it's not my bear, it's Maggie's.

Burns goes to the back garden, where Maggie is playing in the sandpit. Maggie instinctively grabs Bobo.

BURNS
So, good sand today, hmm?  Oh, well, I don't usually, but...

As he puts it in his mouth, a photographer appears on the other side of the fence and takes a photo.

BURNS
Damn you paparazzo!  Well, Maggie, I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sure we can come to some sort of agreement--

He suddenly lunges for the bear, but is too weak to take it from Maggie.

BURNS
Beaten by an infant... what could be more humiliating?

PHOTOGRAPHER
 What a scoop!

BURNS
Okay, Maggie, you win. But I want you to do something for me. Hang onto that bear. Don't make the same mistake I made.

He sighs, then gets up and walks away. He doesn't get very far when Maggie offers him Bobo back.

BURNS
For me? Bobo? Smithers, I'm so happy. Something amazing has happened, I'm actually happy. Take a note! From now on, I'm only going to be good and kind to everyone.

SMITHERS
I'm sorry sir, I don't have a pencil.

BURNS
Oh, don't worry, I'm sure I'll remember it.

The family watch Burns and Smithers walk off.

HOMER
Well, we didn't get any money, but Mr. Burns got what he wanted. Marge, I'm confused. Is this a happy ending or a sad ending?

MARGE
It's an ending, that's enough.

Smithers tucks Mr. Burns into bed.

SMITHERS
There you go.

BURNS
Ah, Bobo, reunited at last. But I can't help but wonder what the future holds for you.  Ah yes, wonder...

He falls asleep. In his dream, the year is 1,000,000 A.D., and apes are using several Homers as slaves, whipping them as they pull carts.

HOMER SLAVES
D'oh! D'oh!

Some apes dig up a pile of rocks, under which is Bobo. A robotic arm takes the bear, which is revealed to be Mr. Burns' head in a jar, with a robot body.

BURNS ROBOT
Bobo, I know I say this every century, but I'll never leave you behind again.

He runs off into the distance, and is followed by Smithers as a robot dog.

SMITHERS ROBOT
Wait for me, sir! Woof!
