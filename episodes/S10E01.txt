 Lard Of The Dance

At the 'Try-N-Save'

LISA
Look Dad, they've got every kind of paper: Loose-leaf, graph, unlined……college-ruled.

HOMER
Can't you just write on your arm like I do?

In red ink on Homer's arm it reads "Red=Meltdown".

Bart hums while grabbing lots of paper clips and rubber bands and putting them in Marge's trolley.

MARGE
All you're getting is rubber bands and paper clips? Don't you need a notebook or something?

BART
Nah, these day's everything's done on computers.

Bart grabs two staplers and starts shooting staples into a cardboard man's head

BART
And staplers. Computers and staplers.

Bart throws the staplers into the trolley.

MARGE


Lisa picks up a "Krusty's Speak-and-Say" toy.

LISA
Krusty's Speak-and-Say?

Lisa pulls the chord.

KRUSTY TOY
S is for shiksa. S-H-I….hmmm….I think there's a T in there somewhere. Ah, look it up.

Milhouse spots Lisa.

MILHOUSE
 Lisa! Stay cool, Milly.

Milhouse grabs a gluestick, slicks his hair back with it, and raises his glasses onto his head. He then walks right into a pen display and falls over. He stands up while picking up pens, pretending like nothing happened. Lisa comes over.

MILHOUSE
Oh, hi, Lisa. Did you have a nice summer? Don't you hate that we have to go back to stupid school tomorrow?

LISA
I like school.

MILHOUSE
Me too! We have so much in common.

LISA
You have a pen glued to your cowlick.

MILHOUSE
If you don't like it, it's gone!

Milhouse pulls the pen off his head, along with a huge chunk of his hair.

MILHOUSE
Uh, you want this?

LISA
 No.

At the Kwik-E-Mart

HOMER
Yo, Apu, give me the usual.

APU
Yes sir. One Kwik-E-Dog, one bubble gum cigar, and the latest issue of Success Magazine.

Homer takes a bite of the Kwik-E-Dog.

HOMER
Hey, this hot dog tastes different.

APU
Yes, I just cleaned out the machine, sir. So the snack you are enjoying has not been soaking in putrid grease.

HOMER
Yeah, but without the grease, all you can taste is the hog anus.

APU
I'm so sorry but I sold it all to the rendering plant.

HOMER
People buy grease?

APU
Oh, yes. They use it to make products such as soap, cosmetics, baby good.

HOMER
Used grease is worth money?  Then my arteries are clogged with yellow gold! I'm rich, Apu! Rich and…

Homer clutches at his heart. He groans, and eventually sighs with relief. While tapping his heart he says…

HOMER
Ahh. Money in the bank.

Back at home, Homer's frying up some bacon.

HOMER
Okay, this bacon's done.

Homer picks up the bacon and throws it onto the floor in front of Santa's Little Helper.

HOMER
And now for the profit taking. 

Homer pours the grease into a tin that Bart's holding.

BART
Uh, dad, I don't think the dog can handle any more bacon.

SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER


HOMER
Looks like he's about ready for another squeezin'.

MARGE
Homer! That side of bacon was for my bridge game tonight.

HOMER
Marge, if you don't mind, I'm a little busy right now achieving financial indepence.

MARGE
With cans of grease?

HOMER
 No. With savings and wise investments.  Of course, with grease.

LISA
Come on, Bart. The bus is here.

Bart puts on his backpack. Homer grabs him.

HOMER
Where do you think you're going?

BART
It's the first day of school.

HOMER
Not for you it isn't. You're in the grease business now.

At Springfield Elementary, Ralph is standing in front of the class with both his eyes taped up.

RALPH
Then the doctor told me that both my eyes were lazy. And that's why it was the best summer ever.

MISS HOOVER
 Thank you, Ralph. Now take your seat.

Ralph walks out of the classroom. From the corridor we hear Nelson.

NELSON
Hey Blindy, have a nice trip!

RALPH


NELSON
Haw-haw

Principal Skinner comes on the speaker.

SKINNER
Attention, please. I need a volunteer for a thankless chore.

Lisa raises her hand.

SKINNER
Shall I assume the only hand in the air is Lisa Simpson's? Thank you, Lisa.

In Skinner's office.

SKINNER
We have a new student, Lisa, and I want you to show her the works. The lunchroom, the tree. But when you get to the trophy case, give her some cock and bull story. They're out for cleaning or whatever.

LISA
Don't worry. I'll help her out. I remember how hard it was to be an outsider. Always trying to fit in. Never quite feeling like…

SKINNER
Lisa, I'd like you to meet Alex Whitney.

ALEX
Your name's Lisa? Shut up. I love that name.

LISA
Did she just tell me to shut up?

SKINNER
Take it outside.

LISA
You'll want a locker in this hallway. It's library-adjacent.

Alex sprays perfume.

LISA
Is that perfume?

ALEX
Don't be such a Phoebe. It's Pretension by Calvin Klein. Wanna try some?

Alex sprays it in Lisa's face.

LISA
 mmm-mm

ALEX
K, so what's the haps in Springfield? What do you guys, like, do for fun?

LISA
well, you'll definitely wanna get yourself a good doll. The new Malibu Stacy has an achievable chest.

ALEX
Dolls? Really? Okay, what else you got?

LISA
Oh, jacks. Jacks are big. They went out for a while but then they came roaring back.

ALEX
Oh, you mean that game with the little rubber ball?

LISA
Oh, don't worry. You'll pick it up fast. Once you get to foursies, you're in the zone.

ALEX
Uh-huh. Isn't that trophy case supposed to have trophies?

LISA
Uh, they were all wiped out in the big trophy fire.

SKINNER
Ah, I see the trophies are still out for cleaning, eh, Lisa? 

Lisa giggles nervously. Down at the Grease Recycling Plant, Homer's grease is being weighed on a machine.

HOMER
Okay, boy. This is where all the hard work, sacrifice and painful scaldings pay off.

EMPLOYEE
Four pounds of grease … that comes to … sixty-three cents.

HOMER
Woo-hoo!

BART
Dad, all that bacon cost twenty-seven dollars.

HOMER
Yeah, but your mom paid for that!

BART
But doesn't she get her money from you?

HOMER
And I get my money from grease! What's the problem?

An "Acne Grease Co." truck passes by Homer and Bart.

HOMER
Wow! Look at that load of grease. Boy, if we're ever going to earn paper money, we have to expand our operation.

BART
Um, I don't know how much more school I can miss.

HOMER
Oh, you'll miss plenty! I have a feeling this business is going to consume our whole lives.

In the school cafeteria, Lisa walks over to her girl friends chattering away.

LISA
Alex, over here! Okay if the new girl sits with us?

GIRLS
Ok, I guess.

LISA
She's a little weird, but let's give her a chance. Guys, this is Alex.

GIRLS
Hi. Hi there.

ALEX
Ooh, twins! Which one is the evil one? 

LISA
 Okay! I'll go get our lunches.

ALLISON
So, Alex. Uh, we've…

Alex's mobile phone rings

ALEX
Just a sec.  Hello?

GIRLS


ALEX
Oh, yeah, like I'd be seen with a Discover card.

Alex hangs up.

SHERRI
You have a cell phone?

TERRI
And a purse?!

From the lunch counter, Lisa mock-coaches Alex

LISA
That's it, don't be shy. Now maybe a little joke to break the ice.

Lisa sees the girls break into loud laughter.

LISA
Or a big joke.

Lisa watches Alex stand up and show off her outfit.

LISA
Careful now, nobody likes a showoff.

Lisa sees the girls walk out of the cafeteria quickly.

LISA
Where are they going? Hey, wait up!

Lisa quickly pays the cashier and carries the two trays a few steps before coming to a realization.

LISA
They left without me.

MILHOUSE
Oh, Lisa! I've got an extra seat, and you've got an extra lunch. Heh, catch my drift, heh?

SKINNER
Milhouse, lower those eyebrows!

Milhouse lowers one eyebrow.

SKINNER
And the other one!

Milhouse lowers the other one. Lisa stares down the corridor where her friends went, and groans.

LISA
So there I am, being nice to Alex, and she takes all of my friends and ditches me!

MARGE
I'm sure they didn't ditch you, honey. Maybe they went off to plan a surprise party for you.

BART
 Yeah! Good one, Mom!

LISA
They only like her because she acts so grown-up with her perfume, and her cell phone, and… oh, and get this, Mom. She drinks iced tea!

HOMER
Lisa, I can't imagine anyone being more likable than you. But apparently this new girl is. So my advice would be to start copying her in every way.

LISA
But, Dad!

HOMER
Ah, ah! Think! Is that what Alex would say?

At school the next day.

ALEX
Oh, there you are! Listen, I'm sorry I ran out on you yesterday, but the girls couldn't wait to show me that tree.

LISA
 Huh, don't give it a second thought, huh, I didn't.

ALEX
Anyway, I got you a little present.

Alex gives Lisa some earrings.

LISA
 Oh! Earrings! Wow, thank you so much, Alex! Oh, but these are for pierced ears.

TERRI
Yeah! Aren't they great?

SHERRI
Alex did ours.

ALEX
Yeah, all you need is a thumbtack and a whole lot of paper towels.

LISA
Uh, but… I don't think I'm ready for pierced ears.

ALEX
Well, maybe you can put them on your doll.

All the girls laugh.

ALEX
Just kidding, Lis'. I'm sure you'll be ready someday.

SKINNER
Oh, Lisa, I was hoping I could count on you again to spearhead our annual school-wide apple pick.

LISA
Absolutely.

ALEX
Apple…pick?

LISA
Yeah, it's great! We have pony rides, sing-alongs, apple bobbing, apple picking, apple everything!

SKINNER
Ah, you forgot apple bobbing.

LISA
No, I didn't.

ALLISON
Didn't your old school have apple-picks?

ALEX
No, we weren't big on fruit. We were more into, like, dances. You know, things that are fun.

TERRI
A dance? Great idea, Alex.

SHERRI
Yeah. Principal Skinner, can we have a dance instead?

GIRLS
Oh, yeah. Please? Let's do it.

SKINNER
Well, uh…we've never had a dance before. Lisa, you'd be doing all the work. What do you think?

LISA
Mmm, I don't know. The ponies might be startled by the loud music.

SKINNER
Well, there wouldn't be ponies.

LISA
Oh. Then, at the risk of being unpopular, I think I'm gonna have to say…

Lisa looks at the girls, and they all look back with pleading eyes. The next scene is Lisa putting up a sign that says 'School Dance Friday'.

SKINNER
School dance? I didn't approve any school dance!

LISA
Yes you did, yesterday! Right by my locker!

SKINNER
Oh, yes. Yes. Um, carry on.

Homer and Bart drive past Springfield Elementary while Bart looks out his window at all the children playing. They stop at Krusty Burger.

BART
When you want grease, go to the source. Good old Krusty Burger.

HOMER
Oh, I'll say. Look at that red-headed kid. There must be twenty dollars worth of grease on his forehead alone.

BART
I was thinking more of the deep-fryer.

HOMER
All right, we'll try it your way.

Homer and Bart go behind the counter towards a pimple-faced teen at a fryer.

PIMPLE-FACED TEEN
Can I help you, sir?

Homer leans right into the teen's face.

HOMER
My God, you're greasy.

PIMPLE-FACED TEEN
Mr. Maruka, Help!

At the back of the store, Homer shovels grease into the back of his car from a large container.

BART
Mom's gonna kill you.

HOMER
If she didn't want her car ruined, she should've done a better job hiding her keys.

The grease in the car suddenly starts to drain out.

HOMER
Hey, what the…?

Two men in orange uniforms are standing next to a large truck with a hose leading from it into Homer's car.

HOMER
Hey! Hey! You're taking our grease!

MAN #1
It's our grease now.

The man takes Homer's shovel and hits Homer on the head with it.

HOMER
Daahhh!!

MAN #2
We run the grease racket in this town.

The men start to leave.

HOMER
Hey, that's my shovel!

MAN #1
We also run the shovel racket.

The two men enter their truck labeled 'Acne Grease And Shovel' and drive away. They honk their horn.

Down at Donner's Party Supplies.

LISA
Okay. Girls, we're gonna need balloons, crepe paper, party hats…

ALEX
Whoa, you've got a Dingo Junction here?

All the girls run into the store, and Lisa follows them, walking. Upbeat music plays as all the girls step out of the change rooms, posing while wearing fancy outfits. Lisa steps out wearing her normal clothes and holding a sexy black dress.

LISA
I am not wearing this.

ALEX
Oh, come on, Lisa. It's totally you. Just, you know, add some accessories, lip gloss, maybe drop five pounds…

LISA
Aren't we a little young for make-up, and…what do you mean, five pounds?

JANEY
Well you want to look nice for your date.

LISA
Date?

ALEX
Hello. For the dance. Eh.

LISA
You guys have dates?

SHERRI
Hello.

LISA
Stop saying "hello"!

ALEX
Okay, calm down, Lisa. DMY.

LISA
What's DMY?

ALEX
Don't Mess Yourself.

LISA
Eww.

ALEX
Yeah, that's why we changed it to DMY.

ALLISON
Don't worry, Lisa. There's still plenty of time. You'll get a date.

LISA
I don't want a date! And I don't want to wear perfume and cocktail dresses. Am I the only one who just wants to play hopscotch and bake cookies and watch The McLaughlin Group? Hello?

The girls walk away.

LISA
 Hello?

Back at home, Homer's on the couch with Marge.

HOMER
Oh, I can't believe those goons muscled me out of my grease business. I've been muscled out of everything I've ever done. Including my muscle-for-hire business.

MARGE
My poor Homie. Couldn't you try some other far-out moneymaking scheme?

HOMER
Ahh, what's the point?

MARGE
You could raise some emus…

HOMER
Emus! Really? Ooh, that's pretty crazy. Nah, I'd only fail, just like I fail at everything.

BART
Hey Dad, I've been thinking. What if instead of giving up on grease, we go for one last big score?

HOMER
Wait a minute. The boy's right! I can't quit now! Aww … you always know just what to say to cheer me up. Emu farm?  You're priceless, Marge!

Homer and Bart leave the room, slamming the door behind.

MARGE


At Springfield Elementary, Nelson sits at a table outside with Wendell, Ralph, Lewis, and Database.

NELSON
The thing about huckleberries is, once you've had fresh, you'll never go back to canned.

Principal Skinner walks up to them.

NELSON
Nuh, um…uh, so anyway, I kicked the guy's ass.

Skinner nods and leaves.

NELSON
Now, if the berries are too tart, I just dust them with confectioner's sugar.

BOYS
Oh, good secret.

LISA
Hey guys.

Lisa's standing next to them wearing the black cocktail dress, red platform shoes, lipstick and earrings. She tries to walk over to them, but stumbles a few times due to her platforms.

LISA


WENDELL
Hi, Lisa.

NELSON
Are you all right?

LISA
No doubt!  Can't a girl fabulize herself before the big dance?

NELSON
You're earlobe's bleeding.

LISA
Oh. So, I guess major muffins like yourselves all have dates, huh?

WENDELL
You better believe it.

LISA
Really? All of you?

DATABASE
Uh, we all have dates, Lisa.

LEWIS
Everyone does.

RALPH
Even me!

LISA
Unbelievable!

Lisa falls backwards due to her large shoes. Her shoes come off her feet and stay where they are. Milhouse is in the nurse's office, sporting a massive wedgie.

NURSE
Another wedgie?

MILHOUSE
Uh-huh.

NURSE
Hang on. I'll get my forceps.

MILHOUSE
Oh, hurry.

LISA
 Milhouse, oh, I've been looking all over for you. Heh, heh, listen, you've always had a crush on me, right? Well, this is your lucky day, 'cause you're gonna take me to the dance, pretty great, huh? See ya!

MILHOUSE
Oh, but I can't! I already asked somebody.

LISA
So un-ask her!

MILHOUSE
But that wouldn't…

LISA
 You're taking me, you got that? And it's gonna be a magical evening!

Lisa sees the sweat pouring off Milhouse's face, and her reflection in his glasses.

LISA
Oh! What am I doing? This isn't me! I'm sorry, Milhouse.

Lisa runs off.

MILHOUSE
I'm free next weekend! There's plenty of Milhouse to go around!

That night, Homer drives out of his garage with 6 steel drums on the side of his car, and a vacuum cleaner on the roof with 6 tubes coming out of it into the drums, and 1 for sucking up the grease.

HOMER
All right, son. We're about to embark on our most difficult mission. Let's bow our heads in prayer. Dear Lord, I know You're busy, seeing as how You can watch women changing clothes and all that. But if You help us steal this grease tonight, I promise we'll donate half the profits to charity.

BART
Dad, He's not stupid.

HOMER
All right, screw it, let's roll!

Homer plants his foot, and as the car turns, all the drums fall off the car.

HOMER
Hmm … I knew I should've attached those somehow.

Lisa's in her room looking through a microscope.

LISA
Lucky parameciums. You don't have to worry about finding dates or dancing.

The parameciums pair themselves up and all start to move around as though they're dancing.

LISA


MARGE
Lisa! I made you some homemade Pepsi for the dance! It's a little thick, but the price is right!

LISA
Thanks, Mom, but I told you I'm not going.

MARGE
Oooh, so you don't have a date. You can still go and have a wonderful time.

LISA
You don't understand, I don't belong there. The other girls are already into fashion and make-up and dating…they make me feel like a little baby.

MARGE
Aw, honey, a baby couldn't have organized a big school dance. Unless, it was especially skilled…or one of those super-babies from Brazil.

LISA
Forget it Mom, I'm not going.

MARGE
But they're counting on you to take tickets. And if you sit there with a brave little smile and a festive bow…why you could be the belle of the ball!

LISA
Mom, you can't possibly believe that.

MARGE
I have to, honey. Or, you can stay here, and we'll have our own dance.  Every Simpson dance now! Bump, bump, bump bump, bump…

LISA
I'll go.

Homer's in the car talking to Bart while on their way to get grease.

HOMER
This better work, boy. I don't wanna wind up working on your mother's emu farm.

BART
Don't worry. This is the score we been dreaming about. The grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied.

The car pulls up to Springfield Elementary. Homer runs the hose from his car to the ventilation duct he's standing next to.

HOMER
Okay, turn on the suction.

Bart turns on the vacuum cleaner. It starts to whir. Homer looks inquisitively at the hose he's holding.

HOMER
It's not working.

He puts his face close to it, and it gets sucked into the hose.

HOMER


Homer manages to pull the hose off his face. His eye is popping out of its socket.

BART
Woah!

HOMER
What is it?

BART
Uh, nothing.

At Springfield Elementary, Lisa is sitting at a table outside the school gym with a bow in her hair, taking people's tickets and stamping their hands.

LISA
 Enjoy the dance.

A couple enters through the doors and dance music is head playing which disco lights shine through the door's opening. Milhouse and his date approach Lisa's table.

MILHOUSE
Wow, Lisa. I really admire your guts. You came here all by yourself at the risk of being labeled a dateless wonder.

Lisa stamps Milhouse's hand really hard.

MILHOUSE
Ow!

LISA
 It slipped.

Milhouse and his date enter the gym. Lisa takes her bow from her hair and tosses it into the bin.

LISA
Ah, it's gonna be a long night.

Meanwhile, Homer and Bart break into the school cafeteria via the ventilation ducts.

BART
Where's the hose?

HOMER
Bringin' up the rear.

BART
Are you as excited as I am?

HOMER
Oh yeah. Well, here goes.

Homer dips the hose into the big container for grease and it starts sucking it up.

HOMER
And now, we wait. So, is this your school?

BART
Well, it used to be.

At that moment, Groundskeeper Willie enters the kitchen. He walks over to the sink and begins to scrub under his armpits with a Brillo pad and Ajax soap while whistling a song similar to the popular folk song //'Jenny Jenkins'. Homer and Bart attempt to sneak away but Willie catches them.//

WILLIE
Eek! I mean, 'ach!' I mean…what are you doin' 'ere?

HOMER
Uh, buh, buh, we're new foreign exchange students from…uh, um…Scotland!

WILLIE
Saints be praised, I'm from Scotland! Where do ya hail from?

HOMER
Uh…North…Kilttown.

WILLIE
No foolin'! I'm from North Kilttown! Do you know Angus McCloud?

HOMER
Wait a minute! There's no Angus McCloud in North Kilttown! Why, you're not from Scotland at all!

WILLIE
Ach, don't be daft. I was born and rai…

Willie notices the hose.

WILLIE
Hey, what the?  My retirement grease!

Homer and Bart make their escape through the ventilation ducts

WILLIE
No! You thievin' grease bandits! I'll kill ya! Wait up!

Homer and Bart scramble on their hands and needs through the ducts trying to escape while Willie is close behind. Homer whimpers as he feels he's going to get caught. Willie grabs Homer's leg.

WILLIE
Dargh! Not so fast, boy-o! Well, if it was up to me, I'd let ya go. But the lads have a temper, and they've been drinkin' all day!

Willie starts pummeling Homer's head with both his fists.

HOMER
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Stop pummeling me! It's really painful!

WILLIE
All right, fine. I'll strangle ya for a while!

Willie grabs the hose and puts it around Homer's head. He pulls tight, and while Homer groans, his left eye pops out. Back at Lisa's table, and she's busy stamping her arm with a star stamp. Skinner comes out of the gym.

SKINNER
Lisa! I have to run home. I need you to keep an eye on the dance.

LISA
Oh, I don't want to go in there, with all the happy dancing couples…

SKINNER
Normally I wouldn't ask, but, uh, it's an emergency. Mother has a June bug cornered in the basement and she needs me to finish it off. Come on, chop, chop.

LISA
All right, all right, DMY!

SKINNER
I know what that means, young lady!

LISA


Lisa opens the gym doors and looks inside.

LISA
Huh?

She sees all the boys on one side, and all the girls on the other side. They all look really nervous and shy. Alex comes up to her.

ALEX
Oh, Lisa, it's terrible. Okay, this dance has gone Titanic!

LISA
What happened?

ALEX
Well, the boys and girls are, like, afraid of each other. They're acting like a bunch of…

LISA
Kids?

ALEX
I know! What is up with that?

LISA
It's because they are kids! And so are we! Come on, Alex, we've only got nine, maybe ten years tops where we can giggle in church, and chew with our mouths open and go days without bathing! We'll never have that freedom again.

ALEX
Mmm. Listen, you can giggle and stink all you want, but I have a credit card, so  on you.

Alex walks off.

LISA


Willie continues to choke Homer with the hose which is trying to suck up grease.

BART
Uh, guys? Guys? The hose!

The hose swells with grease.

HOMER
Bart, please. The groundskeeper and I are trying to settle this like adults.

The hose then explodes in a fountain of grease, shooting the three through the vents. They all scream.

MARTIN


Tiny snow flakes start to fall on Martin. He looks up.

MARTIN
Huh? Look, it's snowing!

The fan in the ventilation duct is chopping up the grease and turning it into grease flakes. All the children gather around in amazement to watch it fall down. Ralph catches a flake on his tongue.

RALPH
Ah, the snowflake tastes like fish sticks!

BART


Bart rides a wave of grease out one of the vents into the gym. Willie and Homer do the same. The entire gym is covered in grease. Milhouse picks some up and licks it.

MILHOUSE
It's like a hamburger milk shake.

CHILDREN


NELSON
Here comes a grease ball.

Luigi enters the gym holding 5 pizzas.

LUIGI
Hey! Luigi bring-a you kids-a free pizza! Why you hafta make-a the fun, ah?

Kids begin throwing the grease at each other, making greasemen out of it, laughing, skating and having all sorts of fun, Homer runs about, trying to take it all back and keep it in his pockets.

HOMER
Oh, that's my grease! It's mine! Give it here!

ALEX
They're playing in grease? Yargh!

LISA
Oh, act your age.

Lisa throws a grease ball at Alex, hitting her in the side of the head.

LISA


ALEX
Oh.

Alex looks at Lisa angrily, then quickly smiles.

ALEX
You are so dead. 

LISA


Alex picks up a grease ball and chases after Lisa.

LISA
Woah!

ALEX
Ow! There was bacon in that.
