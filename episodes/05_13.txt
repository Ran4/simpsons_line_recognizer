MAN 1
I need one twenty-nine-cent stamp.

APU
That's a dollar-eighty-five.

MAN 2
I'd like two dollars worth of gas, please.

APU
Four-twenty.

MARTIN
How much is your penny candy?

APU
Surprisingly expensive!

MARTIN
What a rip-off.

The customers all groan and leave. One man grabs something from a display.

MAN 1
This is what I think of your store!

He twists the product, throws it on the floor and walks out.

APU
Silly customer! You cannot hurt a Twinkie!

Apu picks it up and it pops back into shape. He puts it back, then notices a strange smell. On one shelf a packet of ham reads "Exp. Feb. 6, 1989". He smells the pack.

APU
Jiminy Cricket! Wooh, expired ham.  Oh, this time I have gone to far. No, no one will fall for--

HOMER
 Woohoo! Cheap meat!  Ooh, this one's open.

He starts eating it. Later at home, Homer is on the couch, still finishing it off. His stomach starts to growl.

HOMER
Stomach...churning!  Bowels...clenching! Not much time...  ...must...finish...

He finishes the ham. Cut to an ambulance rushing him to hospital.

DR. HIBBERT
 Well sir, Homer's illness was either caused by ingesting spoiled food, or,  some sort of voodoo curse.

PATTY
Hey, we've just been working the eyes.

She holds up a Homer doll with pins in the eyes. Later at the Kwik-E-Mart, Homer confronts Apu.

HOMER
Your old meat made me sick!

APU
Oh, I'm so sorry.  Please accept five pounds of frozen shrimp.

HOMER
 This shrimp isn't frozen! And it smells funny!

APU
 Okay, ten pounds.

HOMER
Woohoo!

An ambulance rushed Homer to hospital again. Later at home, a television program shows a dog in detective uniform, barking. With each bark a word flies onto the screen. Together, it reads "Bite Back with Kent Brockman and his Channel 6 Consumer Watch Unit". Homer and Lisa are watching this show; Homer is lying ill on the couch and Lisa sitting on the floor.

TV VOICEOVER
Brought to you by... 

HOMER
That dog can sell anything.

BROCKMAN
 Good evening. Here's an update on last week's nursing home expos√©, "Geezers in Freezers". It turns out the rest home was adequately heated; the footage you saw was of a fur-storage facility. We've also been told to apologize for using the term "geezers". Now, coming up next, the case of the cantankerous old geezer.

HOMER
 Oh, rancid meat attack! Stupid parasites. Is there no way I can find justice?

BROCKMAN
If you have a consumer complaint, just call this number--

HOMER
Boring!

LISA
Dad, you should blow the whistle on the Kwik-E-Mart.

BROCKMAN
And now a message from the Church of Latter-Day Saints. 

LISA
Dad, are you listening to me?

HOMER
Shh! Lisa, the dog is barking.

Sometime later at Channel 6 Studios, Homer talks to Kent.

BROCKMAN
All right, are you willing to go undercover to nail this creep?

HOMER
No way, man. No way, man! Get yourself another patsy, man. No way am I wearing a freakin' wire!

BROCKMAN
All right, all right, all right. Would you be willing to wear a hidden camera and microphone?

HOMER
Oh, that I'll wear.

The next day, a van labeled "Ordinary Van" is parked outside the Kwik-E-Mart. Homer and Kent are inside. Kent and another man hold up a large hat with an obviously visible camera inside.

BROCKMAN
We've come up with a camera so tiny, it fits into this oversized novelty hat.

They put it on Homer's head. He struggles to stand upright under the weight.

BROCKMAN
Now, go get us some incriminating footage, and remember: you have to get in and out in ten minutes, or you'll suffer permanent neck damage.

A man with his head bent sideways at right angles appears.

MAN
He's not kiddin'.

Homer enters the Kwik-E-Mart, unable to walk straight because of the hat. Apu looks confused as he slowly makes his way to the counter.

APU
Ooh?

HOMER
Don't be alarmed, Apu. Just go about your daily routine like I'm not wearing the hat.

APU
Your headgear seems to be emitting a buzzing noise, sir. Perhaps you have a bee in your bonnet?

HOMER
Bee? Aah!

He throws the hat on the floor and screams, stomps on it and runs out of the store still screaming and into the van.

BROCKMAN
Homer, that hat's been with the station for twenty years! He had one day left till retirement.

The camera still seems to be working. On the monitor in the van, the crew see Apu going about his business.

APU
Well, time to replenish the hot dog roller. La, la, la...

He drops a hot dog, and it rolls right up to the camera. It's covered with dirt, a dead fly, and a bandage. Apu picks it up.

APU
Aw look, it is encrusted with filth.  Oh well, let's sell it anyway.  Now this is just between me and you, smashed hat! 

BROCKMAN
Hot diggety-dog, we've got him, Mr. Simpson! Now let's...Mr. Simpson?

They see him on the monitor inside the Kwik-E-Mart.

HOMER
One hot dog, please. 

The next day, the Simpsons family watch the "Bite Back" episode

BROCKMAN
Apu, will you ever stop selling spoiled meat?

APU
 No...I mean, yes...I mean...uh-oh...

Apu is also watching at the Kwik-E-Mart in front of some customers. He turns the TV off.

APU
I think I come off very well.

WOMAN
Monster! Run, children.

As they run out, an inspector and two men in suits come in.

INSPECTOR
Apu Nahasapeemapetilan, you have disgraced the Kwik-E-Mart Corporation.

APU
But, sir, I was only following standard procedure.

INSPECTOR
Ah, true. But it's also standard procedure to blame any problems on a scapegoat or sacrificial lamb.

APU
Uh huh, and if I can obtain for you these animals?

INSPECTOR
I'm sorry, Apu: I have no choice. You can no longer wear this name patch.  And you can no longer tell people about our fried pickles.  Now, turn in your pricing gun.

Apu takes it out of a shoulder holster and hands it in.

INSPECTOR
The other one, too.

Apu takes it out if an ankle holster and gives it to the inspector.

APU
 Fired...after all these years of loyal service. I don't want to live any more! 

INSPECTOR
 Give me that wiener!

APU
I don't want to live, sir!

INSPECTOR
Give me that wiener!  No, Apu, it's not worth it!

That night, Apu stands on a bridge, depressed.

APU
What do I do now? I have been drummed out of my profession. I'm a disgrace! Even this babbling brook sounds almost like mocking laughter.

Two homeless guys are underneath the bridge, tickling each other with feathers.

HOBO
 Who needs money when we got feathers?

Apu walks past a pet store. A sign in the window reads "Today Only -- Laughing Monkeys." A bunch of monkeys all begin to laugh and point at him. Apu then wanders down the Simpsons' street and stops in front of their house. A thunderstorm begins.

APU
This is all because of Homer Simpson!

Inside, Homer is on the couch watching TV and laughing. He watches a black stand-up comedian.

HOMER
Oh, oh, stop!

COMEDIAN
Yo, check this out: black guys drive a car like this!  Do, do, chh. Do be do, do be do-be-do.  Yeah, but white guys, see, they drive a car like this!  Dee-da-dee, a-dee-da-dee...

HOMER
 It's true, it's true! We're so lame!

APU
 It is time to settle the score!

He knocks on the door and Homer opens it. Apu, drenched in rain water, threateningly reaches his arms out for Homer. Homer steps back and screams.

 

Homer is still screaming.

HOMER
No, don't kill me! I didn't know there was film in that camera in that hat! I was unaware. I was unaware! 

APU
Mr. Simpson, you misunderstand me. In my village, this is the traditional pose of apology.

HOMER
Oh.

APU
 You know, now that I think about it, it may be a little confusing. Many have died needlessly. I have come to make amends, sir. At first, I blamed you for squealing, but then I realized, it was I who wronged you. So I have come to work off my debt - I am at your service.

HOMER
You're selling what, now?

APU
I am selling only the concept of karmic realignment.

HOMER
You can't sell that! Karma can only be portioned out by the cosmos. 

APU
 He's got me there.

The next day, Marge and the kids see Apu raking leaves on the family's front lawn. Homer comes down the stairs.

HOMER
Is he still out there?

MARGE
Yes, he's raking leaves.

HOMER
What? That's your job! If he starts doing Lisa's wood chopping--

MARGE
If he wants to make it up to you so badly I think you should let him.

HOMER
Okay, okay, I'll let him. But then I get a Chipwich, okay?

Later, Apu serves the family dinner.

APU
It is an honor to begin repaying my debt to you. Back in Ramatpur I was considered quite the gourmet.

MARGE
Hmm, it certainly is exotic.  Ooh, Lisa, is that too spicy for you?

LISA
I can see through time!

HOMER
 Stop being such babies. You can't be afraid to try new things. For instance, tonight I'm using a-- Apu, what do you call this thing again?

APU
A napkin.

HOMER
 Outrageous!

Meanwhile at the Kwik-E-Mart, the inspector and a woman are interviewing Barney.

INSPECTOR
All right, why do you want to become part of the Kwik-E-Mart family?

BARNEY
Because I like people. And I need a place where I'll be out of the sun.

WOMAN
Thank you.

Barney burps and leaves.

INSPECTOR
Hmm... he's head and shoulders above everyone else.

WOMAN
Hold on, there's one more applicant.

James Woods walk into the room and sits down.

INSPECTOR
Name?

WOODS
James Woods, heh.

WOMAN
Previous job experience?

WOODS
Ooh, uh, let's see...True Believer, Salvador, Onion Field, The Hard Way.

INSPECTOR
Wait, wait a minute. Those aren't convenience stores. That sounds more like the resume of a Hollywood movie star!

WOODS
 Well, er...

INSPECTOR & WOMAN
 James Woods!

WOMAN
Why would you want to work at a Kwik-E-Mart?

WOODS
To be honest, in my upcoming movie I'm going to be playing this tightly-wound convenience store clerk and, I kind of like to research my roles and really get into it. For instance, True Believer? I actually worked in a law firm for two months. And then, the film Chaplin, I had a little cameo in that. I actually traveled in time, back to the twenties, where-- oh, heh, I've said too much.

INSPECTOR
Welcome aboard.

The next morning, Homer is taking a shower. He steps out of the cubicle and reaches for his towel, but can't find it. Apu hands the towel to Homer.

APU
Good morning, sir!

HOMER
Aah!

APU
Relax, please. You do not have anything I have not seen before.  What the--

Homer has a lollipop stuck to his chest.

HOMER
Uh... I like to keep a lollipop there.

In the kitchen, Apu stacks cans of corn in a pyramid.

MARGE
Hmm... Apu, we normally store out cans in the cupboard.

APU
Oh they'll never move that way.

Bart and Lisa enter and take a can each.

LISA
Mmm, corn. Haven't had that in a while.

BART
Yeah, delicious corn.

BART & LISA
Bye.

They leave. Marge looks in the fridge.

MARGE
Oh, we're low on milk for Maggie. You want to come with me to the Kwik-E-Mart?

Apu accidentally knocks over the stack of cans in shock.

APU
Please, Mrs. Simpson, I...I cannot go there. That is the scene of my spiritual de-pantsing.

MARGE
Hmm...well, I guess we could go to that new Monstromart.

The Monstromart is a huge concrete block. The store's motto reads "Where Shopping Is A Baffling Ordeal". Inside, the products are oversized, the aisles are wide, and the shelving reaches to the ceiling. Marge picks up a huge box of nutmeg.

MARGE
Ooh, that's a good price for twelve pounds of nutmeg.

APU
Oh, great selection at rock-bottom prices. But where is the love?

An announcement comes over the tannoy.

TANNOY
Attention, Monstromart shoppers. Just a reminder that we love each and every one of you.

CUSTOMERS
Ahh...

Barney pushes a flatbed trolley with a large keg of Duff Beer on it. He passes a display of pancake syrup bottles, shaped like people.

BARNEY
 Excuse me ma'am, where are the lampshades?  Ma'am?  Oh no. I've killed her! It's all happening again!!

He screams and runs into a display of cranberry juice bottles, causing a tidal wave to wash down the aisle that Marge and Apu are in.

SHOP ASSISTANT
 Help me! Help m--  Mmm, it's cran-tastic!

Marge and Apu arrive at the Express Lane, which is strictly "1000 Items Or Less".

APU
Look, Mrs. Simpson, the express line is the fastest line not always. That old man up front, he is staved for attention, he will talk the cashier's head off.

The old man is Grampa Simpson.

GRAMPA
Ah, there's an interesting story behind this nickel. In 1957 I remember it was. I got up in the morning and made myself a piece of toast. I set the toaster to three - medium brown.

APU
Let's cut to... that line.

MARGE
But that's the longest!

APU
Yes, but look: all pathetic single men. Only cash, no chit-chat.

They move through the line quickly. Marge sighs with satisfaction. At the Kwik-E-Mart, James Woods serves Jimbo.

WOODS
75, 85, 90, and a dollar. Thank you, and come again.  Hey wait a minute! Hey! Uh, could I just ask you a question? Did you, heh, did you believe that, I mean, the way I gave you the change, that I sound like a real Kwik-E-Mart, you know, kinda guy?

JIMBO
Actually, I though it was a little laboured. You gotta lose yourself in the moment, man!

WOODS
Yeah, like yeah, okay great! Okay, let's just try that again. Okay, come on.  Come on, hey, hey hey hey! Hey!! Get over here!  Okay, now you're you, I'm me.

JIMBO
I'm me?

WOODS
 Hey, don't jerk me around, fella.

Back at the Simpson home, the family eat dinner.

HOMER
Pass the chutney.

MARGE
Apu, you've been so helpful. If it weren't for him, we'd still be in line at the Monstromart.

LISA
And he taught me how to play the Shenai. 

HOMER
 Oh, that's even worse than the album Grampa released.

BART
And he taught me how to do this.  I got out of school 'cause I told them I was mangled in a car wreck.

APU
Thank you all for the kind praise.

HOMER
Well, you deserve it. All these vegetables are really clearing the cholesterol out of the old heart.

Inside Homer's body, cholesterol makes its way from his stomach to his brain, causing it to spark like electricity.

HOMER
 Uh. Apu friend me good.

LISA
I think what my father's saying is, you're like a member of the family now.

APU
I feel that way too. You see...
Whether igloo hut or lean-to, or a geodesic dome,
There's no structure I have been to which I'd rather call my home.

GRAMPA
 Hello...Aah!

Apu take his cane and he falls down. Music starts and Apu sings.

APU
When I first arrived, you were all such jerks,
But now I've come to looooooove your quirks.
Maggie with her eyes so bright,
Marge with hair by Frank Lloyd Wright,
Lisa can philosophise,
Bart's adept at spinning lies,
Homer's a delightful fella,
Sorry 'bout the salmonella.

HOMER
 Heh heh, that's okay.

APU
Who needs the Kwik-E-Mart?
Now here's the tricky part.
Oh, won't you rhyme with me?
Who needs the Kwik-E-Mart?

MARGE
Their floors are stick-E-Mart.

LISA
They made Dad sick-E-Mart.

BART
Let's hurl a brick-E-Mart!

HOMER
The Kwik-E-Mart is real... D'oh!

FAMILY & APU
Who needs the Kwik-E-Mart?

APU
Not meeee... 

FAMILY
 Forget the Kwik-E-Mart,
Goodbye to Kwik-E-Mart,
Who needs the Kwik-E-mart?

APU
Not me!

The song finishes. Apu leaves the room; the family dust themselves off and sit on the sofa.

HOMER
 Everything really wrapped up nicely.  Hmm, much quicker than usual.

MARGE
I guess we learned that happiness is wherever you find it.

HOMER
And we've all found happiness, every one of us.

He turns on the TV, but hears sobbing coming from outside.

HOMER
Hey, what's that sound?

Apu is sat on the roof of the house.

APU
 Who needs the Kwik-E-Mart? I dooooo...

HOMER
Hey, he's not happy at all. He lied to us through song! I hate when people do that!

 

In the Simpsons living room.

APU
I can't lie to myself, you know. I do miss my Kwik-E-Mart.

LISA
Isn't there anything you can do to get your job back?

APU
I must go to the head office and appeal my case.

HOMER
I'm coming with you. I got you fired, it's the least I can do. Well, the least I can do is absolutely nothing, but I'll go you one better and come along!

APU
But sir, the head office is in India.

HOMER
Okay.

LISA
Dad, that's over ten thousand miles away.

HOMER
I'm aware of that!

LISA
That's over sixteen thousand kilometers!

HOMER
D'oh!

Homer and Apu ride mules across a sandy plain. They reach the edge of a cliff... where Springfield Airport resides in the distance.

APU
I'm sorry we couldn't take a cab, but I spent my last dollar on the plane tickets.

The plane is flying over some mountains.

HOMER
Are we in India yet?

APU
No.

HOMER
Are we in India yet?

APU
No.

HOMER
Are we in India yet?

APU
No.

HOMER
Are we in India yet?

APU
No. Oh wait... now we are.

At the Kwik-E-Mart, James Woods cleans a microwave oven, while on the phone.

WOODS
Tony, T-Tony, you're my agent: you have to do something about this. How can it be the same movie if they're changed my character from a tightly-wound convenience store clerk to a jittery eskimo firefighter? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Hmm. Actually, that's...that's a pretty good explanation. Now this gross, this'll be gross points right in this new...? Okay. Yeah, 'cause those monkeys... yeah, okay, great. Okay, look: book me a flight, rent me an igloo, and tell those dorks at the Kwik-E-Mart that boom! I am outta here, I'm a dot, I'm gone, okay? What do you mean, I gotta give two weeks notice?  Why you frickin', no good mother-  cheese! ...No, not you, I'm just talking to my oven.

Homer and Apu arrive at the airport in India. A group of men are singing in the lounge.

MEN
If you're saved and you know it, clap your hands! If you're saved and you know it, clap your hands!

INDIAN MAN
 Oh, great. Christians.

Homer, Apu, and several other people cling on to the side of a full train.

CONDUCTOR
 Attention passengers, dinner is now being served on the dining car.

The passengers edge their way along the outside of the train, then climb in a window of the next carriage behind. Homer and Apu's journey continues through desert and mountain terrains, ending up out of breath on a twisty mountain pathway.

APU
There she is. There she is, the world's first convenience store.

The camera pans up to show a building at the very top of the mountain.

HOMER
This isn't very convenient.

APU
Must you dump on everything we do?

They approach the store. Inside, an old Hindu man sits towards to rear, drinking a Squishee. A sign behind him reads: "The Master Knows All; Except Combination To Safe"

APU
He is the benevolent and enlightened president and C.E.O. of Kwik-E- Mart - and in Ohio, Stop-O-Mart. He is the one I must ask for my job back.

C.E.O.
Approach, my sons. You may ask me three questions.

APU
That's great, because all I need is one.

HOMER
Are you really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?

C.E.O.
Yes.

HOMER
Really?

C.E.O.
Yes.

HOMER
You?

C.E.O.
Yes. I hope this has been enlightening for you.

APU
But, I must--

C.E.O.
Thank you, come again.

APU
But--

C.E.O.
Thank you, come again.

HOMER
 Well, that was a big bust. Is he really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?

Apu reaches out to strangle Homer.

HOMER
No need to apologize, Apu. It was as much my fault as it was yours.

Apu lunges at Homer, strangling him.

HOMER
 Okay, Apu! I accept your apology!

They fall down the side of the mountain. Returning home, the rest of the family run up.

BART & LISA
Dad! Dad! What'd you bring us? What you bring?

MARGE
How did it go?

HOMER
Fine!  Oh, I mean, not good.

LISA
I'm sorry, Apu. But remember:  who needs the Kwik-E-Mart?

APU
Do you mind? I'm not in the mood.

HOMER
Apu, if it'll make you feel any better, I've learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead.

APU
Yes, yes, you are right, sir. I've got to accept my fate. I have feared it for long enough now. I'm going to go down to the Kwik-E-Mart and I'm going to face my demon!

MARGE
Oh, that'll work out great! We're out of Lucky Charms.

Apu marches into the Kwik-E-Mart, and looks pleased to see something.

APU
Ah, my old Squishee machine. And my scum bucket with flies. And a hot-check list.

James Woods comes to the counter.

WOODS
Hey, you're Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, aren't you? I mean, you're the... God, you're like THE guy, you're a legend around here. Can I ask you, is it true you once worked 96 hours straight?

APU
Oh yes, it was horrible I tell you. By the end I thought I was a hummingbird of some kind.

WOODS
Oh yeah, you know, I studied your old security tapes.

He plays a tape that shows Apu running back and forth, flapping his arms like a bird and making a high-pitched hum.

APU
In a few minutes, I try to drink nectar out of Sanjay's head.

Suddenly, a robber comes in with a gun.

ROBBER
All right, you. Hand over the cash and don't try any funny stuff.

WOODS
Hey, pal, I assure you: if I tried any funny stuff, you would be in hysterics.

ROBBER
Hey, you're James Woods!

WOODS
Oh thank you, yes, thank you.

ROBBER
Well, Mr. Woods, your new song is going to be number three with a bullet!

WOODS
I-- I'm not a singer.

ROBBER
Shut up!

He aims the gun. In slow motion, Apu dives in front of James Woods as the robber fires.

APU
 Nooooooo!

The robber runs off.

WOODS
Apu!

APU
 The searing kiss of hot lead: how I missed you. I mean, I think I'm dying.

WOODS
 Hey.

At the hospital, the Simpsons, James Woods and Dr. Hibbert gather round Apu in a bed.

HIBBERT
 Well, you are a very lucky man, Apu. You see, the bullet ricocheted off another bullet that was lodged in your chest from a previous robbery.

WOODS
Apu, you saved my life. And as a small token of my appreciation, I got you your job back at the Kwik-E-Mart.

APU
Oh! Oh, Mr. Woods, you're--

WOODS
But as for me, I'm off to battle aliens on a far away planet.

MARGE
That sounds like a good movie!

WOODS
 Yes. Yes, a...a movie, yes.

He leaves.

HOMER
Hey, let's all hug Apu!

They hug Apu, then stand around as if waiting for something. Homer looks at his watch.

HOMER
Hey, there's still time. Let's hug him again!
