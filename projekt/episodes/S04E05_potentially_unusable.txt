SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CARNIVAL
The Happiest Place On Earth

BLUE-HAIRED LAWYER
Principal Skinner, "The Happiest Place on Earth' is a registered Disneyland copyright.

PRINCIPAL SKINNER
<chuckles> Well, gentlemen, it's just a small school carnival.

BLUE-HAIRED LAWYER
And it's heading for a great big lawsuit. You made a big mistake, Skinner.

PRINCIPAL SKINNER
Well, so did you. You got an ex-Green Beret mad.

Skinner pokes the eyes of one of the goons, then kicks the blue-haired lawyer in the chest. The third good tries to run away but Skinner picks up a briefcase and throws it at him.

PRINCIPAL SKINNER
Copyright expired.

Nelson, Martin, and some other children are at a sideshow where you shoot water into the mouths of clowns.

CARNY #1
And … begin!

NELSON
This sucks.

Nelson squirts his water into Martin's face.

MARTIN
Aah!

NELSON
Ha-ha!

Bart has his own little sideshow. The 3 Card Monte.

BART
Pick the red, get ahead. Pick the black, set you back.

PRINCIPAL SKINNER
Hmm. I don't recall authorizing this booth.

BART
Good-bye, gentlemen.

Bart creates some smoke and disappears. A child coughs.

GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE
Get your haggis, right here! Chopped heart and lungs boiled in a wee sheep's stomach! Tastes as good as it sounds! Good for what ails ya! <mutters then groans>

Homer's at the "Guess Your Age & Weight" stand.

CARNY #2
I'd say … 53 years old and 420 pounds.

HOMER
Ha-ha, you lose! 36 and 239.

CARNY #2
Hmm.

Bart is looking at Otto who's controlling The Paralyzer.

BART
Hey, Otto-man. I dare you to make this go faster.

OTTO
Ooh! Challenge accepted!

Otto cranks the speed, and the ride goes out of control, hurling a child into the school.

OTTO
I'll be in Mexico till this thing blows over.

An angry crowd runs after him. Milhouse walks up to Jimbo's Spookhouse.

MILHOUSE
Oh, boy! A spookhouse!

He enters it and is confronted by Jimbo, Kearney and Dolph.

KEARNEY
Hand over all your money.

MILHOUSE
<grunts>

BART
Was it scary?

MILHOUSE
Uh-huh.

BART
Ooh, baby. Uh-oh.

Down at the caricatures stand, they're only $3.

CARNY #3
So, girlie, you like roller-skating?

LISA
No.

CARNY #3
Everybody loves roller-skating. Okay, you can turn around now.

An ugly picture of Lisa is up on a projector.

LISA
<gasps>

SPECTATORS
<laughing>

LISA
Oh, my God. I'm ugly.

Principal Skinner is about to draw a raffle.

PRINCIPAL SKINNER
NOW, IN A MOMENT, WE'LL BE RAFFLING OF FOUR GRAND PRIZE
a ride on the famous Duff Beer blimp!

HOMER
A ride on the Duff blimp.

Homer imagines himself in the blimp.

PILOT
You see the circular pattern on those fields? That's from central-pivot irrigation.

HOMER
Wow.

Pilot
Now let's see what's happening at the Super Bowl.
