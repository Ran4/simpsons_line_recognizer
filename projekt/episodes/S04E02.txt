Troy McClure hosts is on TV hosting the Miss American Girl Pageant.

TROY MCCLURE
Live from beautiful Laughlin, Nevada, it's the Miss American Girl Pageant! Brought to you by Meryl Streep's Versatility
Smell like Streep. For Cheap! I'm your host, Troy McClure. And now here come the ladies!

GIRLS
We learned the truth at seventeen, that love was meant for beauty queens.

TROY MCCLURE
Like Miss South Dakota! Miss North Carolina! Miss Indiana! Miss Alaska!

MARGE
Kids, I won't be home tonight so I'm leaving you some low-cal microwaveable TV dinners.

LISA
Uh-huh.

BART
Okay.

MARGE
I'm auditioning for a play. It's a musical version of A Streetcar Named Desire. Isn't that exciting?

TROY MCCLURE
If you ask me, they're all winners! We'll be cutting our first 40 contestants right after this. Let's take a minute to meet our distinguished panel of judges
Skin-care consultant, Rowena! Syndicated columnist, William F. George! Token black panelist, Drederick Tatum! And Mr. Boswell, the man behind those infamous worst-dressed lists. Mr.Boswell, can you give us a sneak peek at this year's list?

MR. BOSWELL
Memo to Goldie Hawn: Cheerleading tryouts were 30 years ago. Let's grow up, shall we?

CROWD
<laughs>

BART
<laughs> He's such a bitch!

MARGE
I haven't been in a play since high school and I thought it would be a good chance to meet some other adults.

HOMER
Sounds interesting.

MARGE
You know, I spend all day alone with Maggie and sometimes it's like I don't even exist.

HOMER
Sounds interesting.

MARGE
<grumbles>

TROY MCCLURE
It's time to name our five finalists, starting with… Miss Montana!

HOMER
A beaut from Butte.

TROY MCCLURE
Miss South Carolina!

HOMER
Nothin' could be finer.

TROY MCCLURE
Miss Delaware.

HOMER
She, uh … Good for her.

MARGE
<singing scales>

HOMER
Marge, keep it down in there!

MARGE
Homer, my audition is in half …

LISA
Hey, look! It's last year's winner, Deborah Jo Smallwood!

DEBORAH JO SMALLWOOD
Tonight, my reign as Miss American Girl comes to an end. And I'd like to apologize one last time for my unfortunate remarks at the United Nations.

Maggie plays 'Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy' on the xylophone.

HOMER
Maggie, cut that racket!

Marge puts on her coat to leave.

HOMER
And where exactly are you going?

MARGE
I'm auditioning for a play.

HOMER
Well, this is the first I've heard about it.

MARGE
I told you several times. It's a musical version of A Streetcar Named…

HOMER
Excuse me, Marge! I think that if you told me, I would remember. I mean, I'm not an idiot.

MARGE
Hm. Well, I-I thought I told you.

HOMER
Kids, back me up.

BART
He's right, Mom.

LISA
Sorry.

HOMER
Match point, Homer.

MARGE
I'm sorry, honey.

HOMER
That's okay. We're none of us perfect.

Down at the Springfield Community Center, the auditions are being held for "Oh! Streetcar!" The piano is playing, and several people are warming up their vocals.

CHIEF WIGGUM
Me May Ma Mo Mu.

FLANDERS
Well, howdy-do, neighbor.

MARGE
Hi, Ned. I didn't know you were an actor.

FLANDERS
Oh, indeedily-doodily. Uh, I've even been in Streetcar once before. I played Blanche DuBois. Mm-hmm. Just part of the fun of going to an all-male school.

LLEWELLYN
Hello! I am Llewellyn Sinclair. I have directed three plays in my career and I have had three heart attacks. That's how much I care! I'm planning for a fourth.

MARGE
Maybe I should have taken a nice calligraphy class.

CHIEF WIGGUM
Oh, forget about it. That Mr. Takahashi's a lunatic.

LLEWELLYN
Quiet!

CHIEF WIGGUM
Sorry.

LLEWELLYN
I am not an easy man to work for. While directing Hats Off to Hanukkah I reduced more than one cast member to tears. Did I expect too much from fourth graders? The review, "Play Enjoyed By All," speaks for itself.

CHIEF WIGGUM
Hm.

LLEWELLYN
Those auditioning for the role of Stanley, take off your shirts. Take off your shirts! Déshabillez votre chemise! Schnell! Schnell! Schnell! Uh-uh. Nope. Try joining a gym. Oh, ye Gods!

OTTO
Hey, man, if you like that, you should see my butt.

LLEWELLYN
You. You're my Stanley.

FLANDERS
Hot diggity! How 'bout that, Marge? Little ol' Stanley me, huh? "Stella. Stella!" <laughs>

WOMAN #1
Hey, look me over…

LLEWELLYN
Next!

WOMAN #2
Won't you come home Bill Bailey…

LLEWELLYN
Next!

WOMAN #3
There's got to be a…

LLEWELLYN
Next!

MARGE
Loo..

LLEWELLYN
Thank you for nothing. You're all terrible! What you ladies don't understand is that Blanche is a delicate flower being trampled by an uncouth lout… <sighs> Forget it! Just strike the sets! Clear the stage! This production is…

Marge is on the phone to Homer.

MARGE
Homie, I didn't get the part. You were right. Outside interests are stupid.

Llewellyn notices Marge on the phone to Homer.

LLEWELLYN
Wait a minute.

MARGE
<groans> I'll come home right away. All right. I'll pick up a bucket of fried chicken, extra skin, rolls, chocolate cream parfait…

Llewellyn grabs the phone off Marge.

MARGE
<gasps>

LLEWELLYN
Stop bothering my Blanche!

MARGE
Oh!

MARGE
I play an aging Southern beauty who's driven to insanity by her brutish brother-in-law, Stanley.

LISA
Wow! My mother the actress. I feel like Lucie Arnaz-Luckinbill.

BART
Are there any jive-talking robots in this play?

MARGE
Mm, I don't think so.

HOMER
Bart, don't ask stupid questions. Is there any frontal nudity?

MARGE
No, Homer.

Back at the Springfield Community Center, the cast are introducing themselves to each other.

HELEN LOVEJOY
My name is Helen Lovejoy, and I'll be playing Stella.

APU
I am Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. I play Steve.

OTTO
My name is Otto! I'm playing Pablo!

LIONEL HUTZ
Lionel Hutz, attorney-at-law. I'm filing a class-action suit against the director on behalf of everyone who was cut from the play. I also play Mitch!

MARGE
I'm Marge Simpson. I'll be playing Blanche. I made some peanut butter brownies for everyone.

LLEWELLYN
Well, would anyone else like a bite of banality?

CHIEF WIGGUM
I would.

Llewellyn gives direction to Ned and Marge.

LLEWELLYN
Stanley.

FLANDERS
Yeah.

LLEWELLYN
You're, you're pulsing with animal lust! You take Blanche and you fling her roughly to the bed.

FLANDERS
Roger-dodger.

Ned grabs Marge and flings her onto the bed. He then climbs onto her angrily.

FLANDERS
Grr.

Maggie crawls out of Marge's hair, takes Ned's glasses and puts them on.

FLANDERS
Aww, isn't that cute! Me without a camera.

LLEWELLYN
Here. My sister runs a daycare center.

MARGE
Hmm. I guess a few weeks wouldn't hurt her.

Down at Ayn Rand School For Tots.

MARGE
Maggie is allergic to strained pears and she likes a bottle of warm milk before nap time.

AYN RAND
A bottle? <chuckles> Mrs. Simpson, do you know what a baby's saying when she reaches for a bottle?

MARGE
"Ba-ba?"

AYN RAND
She's saying, "I am a leech." Our aim here is to develop the bottle within.

MARGE
That sounds awfully harsh.

AYN RAND
Mrs. Simpson. I don't like to toot my own horn, but we're the only daycare center in town that's not currently under investigation by the state.

MARGE
Oh. Well, be a good girl, Maggie. <kisses her>

Marge leaves.

AYN RAND
I'm sorry, Maggie. We don't allow these here.

Ayn Rand takes Maggie's dummy and locks it away with hundreds more.

Back at the Springfield Community Center, Ned and Marge are singing their lines.

FLANDERS
You're a dame and I'm a fella.

MARGE
Stanley, stop or I'll tell Stella.

LLEWELLYN
Passion, Mrs. Simpson. Anger. This man disgusts you!

FLANDERS
All I want is one embrace.

MARGE
I'll twist this bottle in your face. Mm. Mm. Mm!

FLANDERS
<chuckles> Here, Marge, let me. Hate to be an armchair Blanche, but I always gave it one of these. There. There's the ol' face-shredder.

MARGE
Oh.

LLEWELLYN
Mrs. Simpson, if you set out to push the bile to the tip of my throat, mission accomplished! I'm, uh, I'm gonna crawl into bed with a bottle of amaretto. Good day.

Homer's in bed playing Bowling on a Gameboy.

HOMER
Easy, easy. Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes…D'oh!

GAMEBOY
7 - 10 split.

MARGE
Homer, can you run some lines with me?

HOMER
Make Bart do it.

MARGE
It'll just take a sec.

GAMEBOY
Gutter ball.

HOMER
D'oh! You see, Marge, while you're off in your own little world you forgot that other people have problems too.

Back at the School For Tots, Maggie is trying to find things to substitute as her dummy. She tries her thumb, a crayon, a block, and even a Bart Simpson doll, but nothing seems to work.

MAGGIE
<sighs>

Later on that day, Maggie climbs out of bed and wakes up other babies. They go over and look at the dummy collection locked away. The babies stack up all sorts of toys so that Maggie can climb up and try to get the dummies out. The toys all crash down, and Ayn Rand hears it. Ayn Rand comes in to find Maggie amidst the mess.

AYN RAND
Don't like to nap, eh? We have a place for babies like you. The box!

Ayn Rand takes Maggie to a play pen where she is all alone, with only a ball to entertain her.

Back at the Springfield Community Center, Llewellyn is still trying to get Marge to get into character.

LLEWELLYN
All right, let "ham-ateur" night in Dixie commence.

MARGE
I'm sorry, Llewellyn, I just … I just don't see why Blanche should shove a broken bottle in Stanley's face. Couldn't she just take his abuse with gentle good humor?

HOMER
Marge, your ride's here.

MARGE
Homer, it'll just be a few minutes more!

FLANDERS
You're a dame and I'm a fella.

MARGE
Stanley, stop, or I'll tell Stella.

LLEWELLYN
Marge. Marge! I'm asking for white-hot rage and you're giving me a hissy fit.

HOMER
Marge, can I get some change for the candy machine?

LLEWELLYN
Oh, here!

Llewellyn throws a fistful of coins at the ground and Homer bends down to pick them up.

HOMER
Hey, there's some quarters in here.

MARGE
I just don't see what's so bad about Stanley.

HOMER
<grunting>

LLEWELLYN
Stanley is thoughtless, violent and loud. Marge, every second you spend with this man he is crushing your fragile spirit. You can't let that happen.

HOMER
<yelling> Whoo-hoo! Come to Papa. Marge, I'll be out in the car.

FLANDERS
All I want is one embrace.

Homer in the car honks the horn.

HOMER
Marge, move it or lose it!

Marge then imagines Homer instead of Flanders.

MARGE
I'll twist this bottle in your face!! Aaah!

LLEWELLYN
Hallelujah! I've done it again! Ned, you're supposed to overpower her.

FLANDERS
I'm trying! I'm trying!

At the dinner table.

HOMER
Salt me.

MARGE
<southern accent> Here you are, Homer.

HOMER
What the … Why are you talking like that?

MARGE
The play's tomorrow night. <with accent> I've got to stay in character.

LISA
<with accent> Would it help if I talked like this too?

MARGE
It might.

BART
<cockney accent> An' I'll talk like 'is. Bob's yer uncle, mate.

MARGE
That really doesn't help, Bart.

LISA
Big Daddy, would y'all mind passin' a lil' ol' biscuit?

BART
Can I slog off school tomorrow? Got a pain in me gulliver.

HOMER
I'm livin' in a cuckoo clock!

MARGE
Oh, see you later, kids. I've got to go rehearse with Ned.

HOMER
But, Marge, what about dessert?

MARGE
For God's sakes, you can pull the lid off your own can of pudding!

HOMER
Fine. I will! <screeches> Oh, no. My pudding is trapped forever! So I can open my own can of pudding, can I? Shows what you know, Marge.

Outside Flanders' house, Homer yells up at Marge who is rehearsing with Ned.

HOMER
Marge! Hey, Marge!

MARGE
Keep yelling, you big ape.

FLANDERS
Aren't you being a little hard on old Homie?

MARGE
Oh, forget about him. Let's rehearse the bottle scene!

FLANDERS
Oh, let's not and say we did. Hmm?

Later that night in bed.

MARGE
<muttering lines>

HOMER
So, what time does this play start?

MARGE
Why? Are you going?

HOMER
Well, I gotta go, don't I?

MARGE
I'm sure you won't enjoy it. There's nothing about bowling in the play. Oh, wait, there is.

HOMER
Probably not much of it.

MARGE
Why can't you be a little more supportive?

HOMER
'Cause I don't care, okay? I can't fake an interest in this and I'm an expert at faking an interest in your kooky projects.

MARGE
What "kooky projects"?

HOMER
You know, the painting class, the first aid course, the whole Lamaze thing.

MARGE
Why didn't you tell me you felt this way?

HOMER
You know I would never do anything to hurt your feelings. Good night. <snores>

MARGE
<groans>

At the daycare center.

AYN RAND
Playing nicely, little humans? Good, good. Hello, Maggie. Poor little dummard.

Maggie's had enough. She grabs her nappy full of her essentials and goes over to the blinds. She grabs onto the coil and shoots up to a vent. She crawls into it and makes her way to Ayn Rand's office where she spots the keys on her table. Maggy opens up her nappy and ties the string from a Krusty doll around her waste. She then holds two bottles of milk as she jumps down towards the table. The Krusty doll talks from having its string pulled.

KRUSTY DOLL
Hey, kids! I'm flame-retardant. <laughs>

Maggie stops just above the keys. Ayn Rand starts to make her way back to her office. Maggie gasps, drops the milk bottles, grabs the keys, and is pulled back up by the string on the Krusty doll.

KRUSTY DOLL
If I break, buy a new one. <laughs>

Ayn Rand enters her office and one of the bottles rolls off the desk and shatters on the floor.

AYN RAND
<gasps>

Maggie crawls back through the vents. She grabs a plastic gun and shoots a rubber dart across to the locker filled with dummies. She then slides over to the locker on a coat hanger, with the keys in her mouth. When she gets to the locker, she opens it with the keys and throws up dummies to all the babies. Homer arrives with Bart and Lisa to take Maggie home.

HOMER
Maggie, time to go to the… <screeches>

BABIES
<loud sucking>

Homer makes his way slowly through the babies, grabs Maggie, and slowly makes his way back out.

HOMER
<shudders> Babies.

An Alfred Hitchcock look-alike walks past with his dogs.

LLEWELLYN
Perhaps we are all a little mad we who don the cap and bells and tread beneath the proscenium arch. But tonight, you will all be transformed from dead-eyed suburbanites into white-hot grease fires of pure entertainment! Except you. You're not working out. I'll be playing your part.

OTTO
Drag.

CROWD
<murmuring>

CHIEF WIGGUM
Long before the Superdome, where the Saints of football play, lived a city that the damned call home, hear their hellish Rondelet.

CAST
New Orleans! Home of pirates, drunks and whores. New Orleans! Tacky, overpriced souvenir stores. If you wanna go to hell you should take that trip to the Sodom and Gomorrah on the "Mississip". New Orleans! Stinking, rotten "vomity" vile. New Orleans! Putrid, brackish, maggoty, foul. New Orleans! Crummy, lousy, rancid and rank. New Orleans!

WOMAN
What's the matter, honey? Are you lost?

MARGE
I'm lookin' for my sister, Stella.

LISA
It's Mom!

HOMER
Huh?

MARGE
My name is Blanche DuBois. I thought my life would be a Mardi Gras, a never-ending party. Ha! I'm a faded Southern dame without a dime.

APU
I'm collecting for the Evening Star.

MARGE
Come here. I want to kiss you, just once, softly and sweetly on your mouth.

APU
I am just a simple paperboy. No romance do I seek. I just wanted 40 cents for my deliveries last week. Will this bewitching floozy, seduce this humble newsie? Oh, what's a paperboy to do?

Marge kisses him.

APU
Whoo-hoo!

FLANDERS
Stella! Stella! Can't you hear me yell-a, you're puttin' me through hell-a, Stella, Stella!

Marge is attached to guide ropes and is being pulled around by Moe and Barney to make her appear as she's flying.

MARGE
Oh! Oh!

BART
Cool. She can fly.

LISA
I think it's supposed to symbolize her descent into madness.

MARGE
Oh! Oh! Oh!

Marge is talking to Chief Wiggum's character.

MARGE
Whoever you are, I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.

CAST
You can always depend on the kindness of strangers, to buck up your spirits and shield you from dangers.

MARGE
Now here's a tip from Blanche you won't regret.

CAST
A stranger's just a friend you haven't met. You haven't met. Streetcar!

LISA
Yay!

CHIEF WIGGUM
Ah! <chuckles>

LOU AND EDDIE
Yay!

LLEWELLYN
You people out there, you're the stars!

OTTO
Cool!

Bart flies around in the flying device while Lisa holds him up.

BART
Hey, look at me. I'm Blanche DuBois!

LISA
Mom!

Lisa lets go of Bart and he falls to the ground.

BART
<grunts> Way to go, Mom!

LISA
Everybody was cheering for you!

MARGE
Almost everybody.

HOMER
Kids, wait in the car. I want to talk to your mother about this play thing.

BART
<with accent> Lookin' for a spot of fun with the missus, hey, guv'nor?

HOMER
Shut up, boy. Marge, you were terrific.

MARGE
Oh, come on, Homer. By the end, you were so bored you could barely keep your selfish head up.

HOMER
I wasn't bored. I was sad. It really got to me how that lady, uh, um … you know which one I mean. You played her.

MARGE
Blanche.

HOMER
Yeah. How Blanche was sad, and how that guy Stanley should have been nice to her.

MARGE
Yeah? Go on.

HOMER
I mean, it made me feel bad. The poor thing ends up being hauled to the nuthouse when all she needed was for that big slob to show her some respect. Well, at least that's what I thought. I have a history of missing the point of stuff like this.

MARGE
No, Homer, you got it just right.

HOMER
Hey, you know, I'm a lot like that guy.

MARGE
Really?

HOMER
Yeah, like when I pick my teeth with the mail and stuff.

MARGE
Well, maybe just a little.

Marge kisses Homer.
