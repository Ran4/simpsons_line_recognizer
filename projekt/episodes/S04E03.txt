 Homer The Heretic

HOMER
<thinking> Ah, another beautiful day in the womb.

Homer swims around in the womb singing "The Blue Danube" by Strauss. Suddenly, arms grab him and start to pull him out.

HOMER
<gasping> Let go! Let go! I'm all naked and wet!

MARGE
Get up, Homer. It's time for church.

HOMER
I don't wanna go.

MARGE
It's church. You have to go.

HOMER
Too cold out.

A polar bear is going through their trashcans.

MARGE
I'm tired of having this argument every Sunday. Get dressed.

HOMER
Oh, stupid, itchy church pants. <grunting> One size fits all, my butt!

MARGE
Come on. We're going to be late.

Homer's pants tear.

HOMER
Forget it. I'm not going.

MARGE
<grumbles>

Marge, Lisa, Bart and Maggie all drive to church without Homer.

BART
Hey, where's Homer?

MARGE
Your father's … resting.

BART
"Resting" hungover, "resting" got fired? Help me out here.

Meanwhile, Homer is all wrapped up in bed.

HOMER
Ahhh, I'm just a big, toasty cinnamon bun. I never wanna leave this bed. Uh-oh. Gotta take a whiz. Think, man. Think. Think, think, think. Oh, I better get up.

Homer goes to the toilet.

HOMER
I'm whizzin' with the door open, and I love it!

Homer has a shower.

HOMER
<sings> Why, oh, why, Delilah! Brrrah!

NO SOAP RADIO
It's 11 KBBL degrees below zero. I hope you're someplace warm.

HOMER
You bet your sweet … ass! <chuckles>

At church, everyone is freezing.

REVEREND LOVEJOY
I'm afraid our furnace isn't working.

MAN
Yeah, what's the story?

REVEREND LOVEJOY
But let's just put it out of our minds and turn to the lamentations of Jeremiah … long version. Joy is gone from our hearts. Our dancing has turned to mourning.

At home, Homer cranks the heater and the record player. "Short Shorts" by the Royal Teens starts playing and Homer dances along.

RECORD PLAYER
Who wears short shorts?

HOMER
I wear short shorts.

Homer goes to the fridge.

HOMER
The perfect chance to make my patented, space-age, out-of-this-world moon waffles. Let's see here. Caramels. Waffle batter. Liquid smoke. Oooh, waffle runoff. Mmm, fattening.

Back at the church…

REVEREND LOVEJOY
And he was cast into the fiery cauldron of hell! The searing heat, the scalding rivers of molten sulfur!

BART
Ahhh, I'm there.

Back home, Homer drops some ice-cream on his chest.

HOMER
Uh-oh. <whistles> Here, boy.

Santa's Little Helper comes in and licks the chocolate ice-cream off his chest.

HOMER
<laughing> Okay, okay, okay, okay.

REVEREND LOVEJOY
The service has ended. Go in peace.

The church organ plays as everyone goes to leave.

FLANDERS
<grunting> The door's frozen shut. And it's the only way out!

CROWD
<chattering>

LISA
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be…

BART
Lisa, this is neither the time nor the place.

Back home, Homer's listening to the radio while drinking out of a mug.

MAN #1
That was Johnny Calhoun with "Gonna Find Me a Genie With a Magic Bikini.

MAN #2
Haha, 'course Johnny's next record was a spoken word album of his right-wing political views. It kinda killed his career. If you can tell me the name of that album, call our contest line now.

HOMER
<gasps> I know that!

Homer goes through his records and finds it. He rings up the radio station.

HOMER
Hello? This is Homer Simpson.

MAN #1
Homer, can you name that title?

HOMER
"This Things I Believe."

MAN #2
Uh, can we accept that?

The sound of a cash register ringing is heard down the phone.

HOMER
Woo-hoo!

At the church, Groundskeeper Willie is busy unfreezing the door.

REVEREND LOVEJOY
How's that door coming, Willie?

GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE
Miracles are your department, Reverend.

REVEREND LOVEJOY
Uh, while we're waiting, why don't I read from the Sunday bulletin? Card table for sale. Top badly damaged. Leg missing. Otherwise fine. One dollar or best offer.

Homer and the cat are on the couch at home watching TV.

WOMAN ON TV
You must be the three chiropractors I sent for. Now, start manipulating my spine.

CURLY
Hey, Moe, we don't know nothin' about manipulatin'.

MOE
You heard the lady. Grab her spine and get crackin'.

The sound of a spine cracking is heard.

HOMER
<chuckling> Moe is their leader.

CURLY
<whooping>

MOE
Why, you!

Sound of head being hit.

CURLY
Hey!

Groundskeeper Willie nearly has the doors open.

GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE
<grunting> Huzzah!

REVEREND LOVEJOY
Plea-Please, Christians, don't push.

BART
Excuse me. Pardon me. Whoop. Coming through. Howya doing? Love that hat, baby.

Homer's still watching TV.

HOMER
Come on, TV. Give me some of that sweet, sweet pap!

MAN ON TV
Well, let's define our terms, gentlemen. Are we talking about redistricting or are we talking about reapportionment?

HOMER
Oh, well, can't win 'em all.

MAN
We interrupt this public affairs program to bring you a football game.

HOMER
Yes!

Marge is in her car trying to start it. The engine won't turn over, and Marge imitates the sound.

LISA
Give it a little more gas.

Marge pumps on the pedal.

LISA
No, no, that's too much. You know what I think would help?

MARGE
What?! What would help?!

LISA
Nothing.

Homer is still watching TV.

ANNOUNCER
Oh, doctor, a 98-yard triple reverse ties the score at 63-63! We have seen nothing but razzle-dazzle, here today three visits from Morganna the Kissing Bandit and the astonishing return of Jim Brown.

HOMER
Woo-hoo!

Homer looks down on the floor and sees a Penny.

HOMER
<gasps> Is that what I think it is?

ABRAHAM LINCOLN
Mm-hmm.

HOMER
I found … a penny! Could this be the best day of my life?

Homer imagines his wedding, a toppled beer truck in which he's dancing around in beer.

HOMER
Looks like we have a new champion.

The family arrives home.

HOMER
Ah, my beloved family. How was church?

BART
Get bent, you old bat.

LISA
Just fun. Fun, that's what it is.

MARGE
<snorts>

HOMER
I, on the other hand, have been having the best day of my life, and I owe it all to skipping church.

MARGE
That's a terrible thing to say! Kids, your father doesn't really mean that.

HOMER
Like fun I don't. Marge, I'm never going to church again!

MARGE
Homer, are you actually giving up your faith?

HOMER
No! No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, yes.

MARGE
I can't believe you're giving up church, Homer.

HOMER
Hey, what's the big deal about going to some building every Sunday? I mean, isn't God everywhere?

BART
Amen, brother.

HOMER
And don't you think that the Almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week?

BART
Tell it, Daddy.

HOMER
And what if we pick the wrong religion? Every week we're just making God madder and madder.

BART
Testify!

MARGE
<grumbles>

That night, Marge is saying prayers for Homer.

MARGE
Lord, my husband is by no means perfect, but he's a kind, decent man. Please show him the error of his ways.

HOMER
Marge, come to bed.

MARGE
No, Homer. He doesn't mean to be sacrilegious, Lord. He just likes to sleep in on Sundays.

HOMER
Marge. Come to bed, Marge.

MARGE
<whispering> Lord, please. He's not a bad person, Lord, really. He just sometimes…

HOMER
It's good for what ails ya.

MARGE
He doesn't mean any harm.

HOMER
I can wait all…<snoring>

Homer starts dreaming that he's down on the couch watching TV. Suddenly there's a loud rumble and God lifts off the roof to Homer's house.

HOMER
<gulps> God?

GOD
Thou has forsaken my church!

HOMER
Well, kind of, but…

GOD
But what?

HOMER
I'm not a bad guy. I work hard and I love my kids. So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to hell?

GOD
Hmm, you've got a point there. You know, sometimes even I'd rather be watching football. Does St. Louis still have a

HOMER
No, they moved to Phoenix.

GOD
Oh, yeah.

HOMER
You know what I really hate about church? Those boring sermons.

GOD
Oh, I couldn't agree more. That Reverend Lovejoy really displeases me. I think I'll give him a canker sore.

HOMER
Give him one for me.

GOD
I will.

HOMER
So I figure I should just try to live right and worship you in my own way.

GOD
Homer, it's a deal. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to appear on a tortilla in Mexico.

The next day, Homer is walking around his garden in a robe.

LISA
Dad, can I ask you a question?

HOMER
Sure, honey.

LISA
Why are you dedicating your life to blasphemy?

HOMER
Don't worry, sweetheart. If I'm wrong, I'll recant on my deathbed. Hello, my animal friends. Peace be with you.

Homer goes to the shower and the animals are still on his shoulders.

HOMER
Guys, please, could you give me five minutes?

Marge has Reverend Jovejoy around for dinner.

MARGE
Reverend Lovejoy, I had a bit of an ulterior motive in inviting you to dinner.

REVEREND LOVEJOY
What?!

MARGE
No, it's nothing bad. I'm just concerned because my husband hasn't been attending your services lately.

HOMER
Well, I wasn't sure I was doing the right thing but then God himself told me I should seek a new path.

REVEREND LOVEJOY
Oh, really?

HOMER
Yeah. He appeared before me in a dream, and I knew that was special because I usually dream about naked … Marge.

MARGE
<groans>

BART
So, Homer, you saw the big cheese? What'd he look like?

HOMER
Perfect teeth, nice smell, a class act all the way.

MARGE
Homer, you're crazy! Tell him this is all crazy.

REVEREND LOVEJOY
Homer, I'd like you to remember Matthew 7:26. The foolish man who built his house on sand.

HOMER
And you remember … Matthew 21:17.

REVEREND LOVEJOY
"And he left them and went out of the city into Bethany and he lodged there"?

HOMER
Yeah. Think about it.

Homer's down at Moe's.

HOMER
Hello, work? This is Homer Simpson. I won't be coming in tomorrow. Religious holiday. The, uh, Feast of Maximum Occupancy.

MOE
Pretty slick.

HOMER
You should join my religion, Moe. It's great. No hell, no kneeling…

MOE
Sorry, Homer. I was born a snake handler, and I'll die a snake handler.

Back at home the doorbell rings. Homer answers it.

FLANDERS
Neighbor, I heard about your heresy, and we've made it our mission to win you back to the flock.

HOMER
No sale.

FLANDERS
Homer, Christian life isn't all praying and sacrifice. Hey, dig this.

FLANDERS FAMILY
God said to Noah, there's gonna be a flood-y, flood-y.

Homer slams the door. At Homer's work, Homer's awoken by his phone.

FLANDERS FAMILY
Rain came down. It started to get muddy muddy.

Homer's driving home when Ned drives up next to him and asks him to lower his window.

FLANDERS FAMILY
Get those animals <clap> out on the ark-y ark-y.

HOMER
Leave me alone.

TODD
Dad, the heathen's getting away.

FLANDERS
I see him, son.

Ned floors it and drives after Homer. Homer jumps the tracks in front of the train, and Ned drives through the train. Homer drives off the edge of a peer onto a boat full of garbage. Ned slams on his breaks.

FLANDERS
Ah!

HOMER
<laughs> Where are we going?

GUY
Garbage Island.

The boat's horn blares.

Back home, Bart, Lisa, Homer and Maggie watch Itchy and Scratchy in "Flay Me To The Moon".

FAMILY
<laughing>

MARGE
Let's go, kids.

BART
How come we have to go to church and Dad gets to stay home and watch cartoons?

MARGE
<groans> I have a responsibility to raise these children right, and unless you change, I'll have to tell them their father is … well, wicked.

HOMER
Kids, let me tell you about another so-called "wicked" guy. He had long hair and some wild idea, and he didn't always do what other people thought was right. And that man's name was … I forget. But the point is … I forget that too. Marge, you know who I'm talking about. He used to drive that blue car.

MARGE
Kids, could you wait outside for us? Homer, please don't make me choose between my man and my God because you just can't win.

HOMER
There you go again. Always taking someone else's side. Flanders, the water department, God.

MARGE
I'm only going to ask you one last time. Are you sure you won't come with us to church?

MAN ON TV
Coming up next: make your own ladder.

HOMER
Very sure.

At church.

REVEREND LOVEJOY
My friends, the devil walks among us!

CONGREGATION
<chattering>

Bart grabs a man that looks like the devil.

BART
I got him!

REVEREND LOVEJOY
No, don't look for the pitchfork and pointy tail. Today's devil has assumed a more seductive form … pleasing to the eye.

HOMER
Ah … an interview with Lorne Michaels. Ah. Wait, that's no good. Hey, now we're talking. "Our unabashed dictionary defines I.U.D. as "love springs internal." <laughs> I don't get it.

The doorbell rings.

KRUSTY
Hello. I'm collecting for the Brotherhood of Jewish Clowns. Last year, tornadoes claimed the lives of 75 Jewish clowns. The worst incident was during our convention in Lubbock, Texas. There were floppy shoes and rainbow wigs everywhere. It was terrible! <sobs>

HOMER
Wait a minute. Is this a religious thing?

KRUSTY
A religious clown thing, yes.

HOMER
Sorry.

KRUSTY
Well, bless you any…

Homer closes the door.

REVEREND LOVEJOY
Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy!

Homer's a the Kwik-E-Mart buying a Crate-O-Duff and some cigars.

HOMER
Apu, I see you're not in church.

APU
Oh, but I am. I have a shrine to Ganesha, the god of worldly wisdom, located in the employee lounge.

HOMER
Hey, Ganesha, want a peanut?

APU
Please do not offer my god a peanut.

HOMER
No offense, Apu, but when they were handing out religions you must've been out taking a whiz.

APU
Mr. Simpson, please pay for your purchases and get out and come again.

REVEREND LOVEJOY
Pride goeth before destruction!

HOMER
Boy, everyone is stupid except me.

Homer falls asleep on the couch holding a beer and a cigar. The cigar falls onto a Playdude and starts a fire.

HOMER
<snoring> Marge, turn down the heat. That's better.

HOMER
<snoring>

Santa's Little Helper runs in. He chews at Homer's pocket and a Hershey's chocolate bar falls out. He runs off with it. Some fire runs up a phone line onto the couch and singes Homer's hair.

HOMER
<screams> Fire! What do I do? What do I do? <coughing> Oh, the song. The song. When a fire starts to burn, there's a lesson you must learn. Something, something, then you'll see, you'll avoid catastrophe. D'oh! <coughing>

Homer faints. Apu spots fire coming from Homer's house.

APU
<gasps> Fire at the old Simpson place!

He puts on his fire helmet and jacket.

APU
You're on your honor not to steal anything.

KEARNEY
Oh, we won't.

Apu picks up Jamshed and puts him on the counter.

APU
Little Jamshed, the store is in your hands.

JAMSHED
How I have waited for this day. <cocks shotgun>

Dolph, Kearney and Jimbo all look stunned.

The fire engine speeds towards the fire. It has to stop for a family of ducks crossing the road.

DUCKS
<quack>

APU
You ducks are really trying my patience! But you're so cute.

Ned runs up to Homer's window and seems Homer lying on the floor.

FLANDERS
Homer! Homer!

Ned kicks in the door, picks up Homer and tries to get back out, but a plank of wood that's on fire falls and blocks his escape.

FLANDERS
No!

The floor gives way and Ned falls through it, only surviving by holding onto Homer who's stuck in the gap.

HOMER
<moans>

Ned climbs back up and carries Homer upstairs. He throws a mattress out of the window and gets ready to throw Homer out.

FLANDERS
Dear Lord, may your loving hand guide Homer to the mattress, square and true.

Ned pushes Homer out the window who hits the mattress and bounces back in through the bottom window.

FLANDERS
Okay.

Ned follows Homer with a twist. He then carries Homer back out the window. The fire engine finally arrives.

[Siren Wailing]

HOMER
<coughs> Flanders, you saved me. Why?

FLANDERS
Heck, you'd have done the same for me.

Homer imagines Ned trapped in his burning house, while Homer lies in his hammock.

FLANDERS
Help! Help!

HOMER
<laughs>

Homer comes back to reality.

HOMER
That's right, old friend.

BART AND LISA
Dad!

MARGE
Oh, Homie, are you all right?

HOMER
Our magazines and roach traps, gone. All gone.

Krusty runs out of the house with the cat on his face.

SNOWBALL II
<screeching>

KRUSTY
I saved your cat. Ow! That hurt.

BARNEY
Hey, what are these axes for?

CHIEF WIGGUM
I don't know. Chopping stuff.

BARNEY
Gotcha.

Barney starts chopping the letterbox.

CHIEF WIGGUM
Uh, that's some nice chopping.

LISA
Truly, this was an act of God.

Ned's house catches alight.

HOMER
Hey, wait a minute. Flanders is a regular Charlie Church and God didn't save his house.

A cloud forms over the fire on Ned's house and puts it out, then a rainbow appears.

HOMER
D'oh!

TOTAL DISASTER INSURANCE GUY
Any valuables in the house?

HOMER
Well, the Picasso, my collection of classic cars—

TOTAL DISASTER INSURANCE GUY
Sorry. This policy only covers actual losses, not made-up stuff.

HOMER
Well, that's just great.

KENT BROCKMAN
Fire, man's oldest foe. Insatiable, remorseless, unquenchable.

CHIEF WIGGUM
Hey, it's out.

EVERYONE
<cheering>

KENT BROCKMAN
Coming up next, "Which Work Better: Springy Clothespins or the Other Kind?"

HOMER
You know, I have a feeling there's a lesson here.

MARGE
Yes, the lesson is…

HOMER
No, don't tell me. I'll get it. Oh, I know. The Lord is vengeful. Oh, spiteful one, show me who to smite and they shall be smoten.

FLANDERS
Ha, Homer, God didn't set your house on fire.

REVEREND LOVEJOY
No, but he was working in the hearts of your friends and neighbors when they went to your aid, be they Christian, Jew or… miscellaneous.

APU
Hindu. There are 700 million of us.

REVEREND LOVEJOY
Aw, that's super.

HOMER
I was rude to every one of you, and you saved my life when you could have just left me to fry like the proverbial pancake that I am.

MARGE
Oh, Homie, I'm so glad to hear you say that.

REVEREND LOVEJOY
Now, would you give church another try?

HOMER
I'll be there next Sunday, front row, center.

The next Sunday, Homer's in church.

HOMER
<snores>

Homer dreams that he's up in Heaven with God.

GOD
Don't feel bad, Homer. Nine out of ten religions fail in their first year.

BEN FRANKLIN
That's game, Hendrix!

HOMER
God, I gotta ask you something. What's the meaning of life?

GOD
Homer, I can't tell you that.

HOMER
Come on.

GOD
You'll find out when you die.

HOMER
I can't wait that long.

GOD
You can't wait six months?

HOMER
No, tell me now.

GOD
Well, okay. The meaning of life is …
