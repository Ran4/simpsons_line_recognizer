 Bart The Genius

Maggie finishes placing an 'E' block on top of a pile of other blocks. After looking at her tower, she knocks it down. A Scrabble piece falls on the floor and Lisa picks it up. The family is playing Scrabble. Marge places an 'H' on the board to spell 'HE'. Homer looks at his tiles.

HOMER
 Hmm. How can anyone make a word out of these lousy letters?!

Homer's tiles spell O-X-I-D-I-Z-E. He instead places a 'D' to make the word 'DO'. Lisa places an 'I' to make the word 'ID'

LISA
'Id'. Triple-word score!

HOMER
No abbreviations.

LISA
Not I.D. Dad. 'Id'. It's a word!

BART
As in 'This game is stoop-id'. Here we go. Kwyjibo. K-W-Y-J-I-B-O. Twenty-two points, plus triple-word-score, plus fifty points for using all my letters. Game's over. I'm outta here.

Bart gets up to leave. Homer grabs his arm.

HOMER
Wait a minute, you little cheater! You're not going anywhere until you tell me what a kwyjibo is.

BART
Kwyjibo. Uh â€¦ a big, dumb, balding North American ape. With no chin.

MARGE
And a short temper.

HOMER
I'll show you a big, dumb, balding ape!

Homer leaps at Bart, and Bart makes a run for it.

BART
Uh oh. Kwyjibo on the loose!
