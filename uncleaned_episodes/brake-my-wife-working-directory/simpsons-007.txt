INT. VIEWING AREA - CONTINUOUS
Lisa gets up and walks over to a closed display labeled
“PENGUIN HABITAT - UNDER REPAIR”. She looks around, then
opens the door and peeks inside. PENGUINS fly gracefully
around. When they see Lisa is watching them, they quickly
land and return to their Charlie Chaplin walk. j
ANGLE ON THE LARGE OPEN TANK
Holding an ominous-looking SHARK, MANTA RAY, SWORDFISH,
OCTOPUS, etc. (A plank leads to the tank’s edge; an
EMPLOYEE stands at the top, dumping some food, then walks
away. Bart and Milhouse walk up.)
BART
Hey, I bet I could clear.that tank on
my skateboard.
Bart pulls his skateboard out of his backpack. A FONZIE~
TYPE steps out of the shadows.
FONZIE-TYPE
Eyyy. Don’t jump the shark. I did,
and now I'm hanging out with these
losers.
He points to a wall where we see a derelict “Vinnie
Barbarino”, “Mr. T” and “Maxwell Smart" (talking to his
shoe).
“VINNIE BARBARINO”
Wha... where... who...?
BART
No, I've gotta do this. For the most
sacred of reasons: boys will be boys.
He starts to climb up to the plank.
